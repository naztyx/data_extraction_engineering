There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series.I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.There is every kind of action imaginable. So many weapons, styles, chases, vehicles, animals, everything. So much creativity with the kills. Amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles (gun\/sword combo is my fave).The music is awesome as usual, maybe even a step up. It enhances every action scene. The cinematography is pristine. So many beautiful shots, so many mesmerizing locations for the action. It is stylistically beautiful.There are a couple of scenes that are shot in such a creative way that I've never seen before. One is an overhead shot one-take that I couldn't believe. It takes the movie to a new level. So many scenes feel like they're a video game brought to life. Numerous times it feels like the VR game Pistol Whip.Donnie Yen is awesome. End of paragraph.About an hour into this nearly 3-hour movie, I felt like I experienced enough action amazingness for an entire movie. I was in a state of ecstasy. Not only was this looking like the best of the series, I started wondering if this would be a landmark action flick. Maybe it's my own fault for setting expectations so high mid-movie, but the second half is more flawed, though still awesome.The subplot with the tracker doesn't seem at all consequential. And his dog attacks were already done, and better, with Halle Berry in Parabellum. A few of the issues I had with Parabellum pop up again, like overdoing it sometimes with the damage he takes. For example, instead of getting hit by one car, he gets hit by three cars. And that's a mild example. Also, it's fairly anticlimactic.Even with those flaws, I had a BLAST with this movie and will definitely see it at least once more in theaters. Seeing it on a premium screen is a must. Loudest speakers, biggest screen. TRUST ME.EDIT: I was itching to go again since opening night. I wasn't able to wait more than 5 days. On second viewing, I still felt the same flaws, but I didn't care. The action is incredible. It has at least three of my all-time favorite action scenes. I want to watch these scenes a hundred times.It's definitely not perfect, but I still consider it an action landmark (last time I said that was Mad Max: Fury Road). Every other action movie should learn from this. Updating rating from 8 to 9 stars.

I thought the franchise was losing a little momentum in chapter 3 so I was worried this could be disappointing. It's not. It's even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people. If you liked the first three movies, get your ass to the cinema. Yeah."},{"users":"cadillac20","ratings":"10","titles":"Not Just The Best John Wick, But Possibly One Of The Best Action Movies Ever","reviews":"Ever since the original John Wick, the franchise has set a standard of what action in Hollywood should be. Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here, but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet.John Wick is in a bad way as we open up. He's a man on a mission to get out from under the High Table with seemingly no end in sight. As he blazes a trail of bullets and corpses, those who have helped him or crossed his path find their own lives disrupted. With all hope lost, he soon finds the opportunity he's looking for when he discovers that he can put his life on the line for a chance to finally get out. The film brings with it a whole host of new characters, including Donnie Yen's Caine, Shamier Anderson's Tracker, Hiroyuki Senada's Shimazu, Rina Sawayama's (in a fantastic big screen debut) Akira, Scott Adkins' Killa, and of course Bill Skarsgard as new villain Marquis. It's a full cast, but everyone gets a chance to shine and could easily have their own films. Donnie Yen in particular demonstrates, once again, that he is a legend in this industry with several great fights of his own. But, of course, this is Keanu's film all the way and he gets to bring everything with him in the biggest film yet.Covering four continents, we get fights on a massive set of stairs, fights in the middle of traffic, at one of the coolest looking hotels ever shown on screen, and so on. The fighting, of course, is exceptional, and it brings nunchakus, dogs, throwing stars, swords, guns, and so much more. It's everything a John Wick fan could want and, because these films are so technically proficient, you never feel like you're missing any of the action. Possibly the most creative choice is my favorite scene, one that combines a visually fantastic weapon with a shot choice that is unusual for action films of this nature, but the combination of these two pushes the scene into maybe one of action film's greatest scenes.Admittedly, the story does leave a bit to be desired, but the minor complaints about these kinds of things pale in comparison to what we get. Hollywood has a new film to hold itself to and I have a feeling that (at least for me) action filmmaking will be judged by the standard this movie sets. It's such a blast, I already want to see it again."},{"users":"tkdlifemagazine","ratings":"9","titles":"The Best John Wick Sequel","reviews":"John Wick: Chapter 4 picks up where Chapter 3: Parabellum left off. As has been the tradition in the sequels to this beloved martial arts action franchise the action starts from the very inception of the film's opening, and lasts until the curtain falls. JW4 is no exception to that rule. What it does do is improve on the prior installment, and solidify Keanu Reeves as the greatest martial arts action star of all time. If you don't accept that notion, then you must accept the fact that it solidifies Reeves and Director, Chad Stahelski, as the greatest martial arts action pairing of modern times.The film opens in New York City, the home of the notorious Continental Hotel, and takes us to Osaka Japan, Paris France, and Berlin Germany. Each of those cities plays a major role in Reeves' quest to seek revenge against the High Table for the acts outlined in the prior films, and to seek his unconditional freedom from service to their order.As the story unfolds we learn a bit more about Wick's past and upbringing than we did in the prior films, but not enough to get bogged down in. He uses his connections to his past, and the help of some old friends to find a path to level the playing field with the High Table's Emissary, The Marquis, played masterfully by Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd. Skarsg\u00e5rd makes the character memorable, and unique, with just a hint of Santino from the second installment.Keanu Reeves as John Wick in John Wick 4.

It was somewhat of a comeback for the legendary Keanu Reeves and reinvigorated the action genre. Since then it's become THE action juggernaut franchise. Now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels, this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.One of the most surprising aspects of this particular entry, is the story being written as well as it is. Something that is hard to come by in the genre at times. Not saying the others in the franchise weren't but this is easily the best story diving deeper in the high table aspects as well as John Wick's true emotions . The rich characterization is also at its best with outstanding additions like Skaarsgard, and even more screen time for supporting greats like Fishburne to compliment the magnificent Reeves. RIP Lance Reddick. It's nice to have such substance amongst the endless high octane ballistic visuals.Speaking of ballistic, this movie goes more all out than any I've seen for insanely well crafted choreographed shootout and fight scenes. Just when you thought you've seen it all, Stahelski\/Reeves prove their action minds are ever evolving. These guys were born to make action movies together.The extremely vibrant colors and plethora of locations is also a feast for the eyes. The sharp atmospheric imagery creates the ultimate backdrop for not only the action but also just the dialogue. The sound is also top notch and perfectly compliments the intensity. It's just an absolute sensory journey that you don't get in too many action films aside from the Wick genre.Overall the limitless and outrageous action alone is nothing like we've seen before for the genre or just cinema in general . But also this rich unique story may only build Wick's timeless character for more films in the future which at this momentum will be welcomed."},{"users":"lovemichaeljordan","ratings":"8","titles":"How Can Anyone Choose to Watch Marvel Over This?","reviews":"Most American action flicks released these days have poor screenplays and overuse computer-generated imagery. The John Wick franchise is one of the few exceptions, along with Mission Impossible. These franchises keep getting better with every entry. Hollywood can make action masterpieces, but Marvel has greater demand, so that's what we get most of. It's a shame.The stunts and choreography are beyond impressive. Every artist involved does their job to perfection. Donnie Yen's performance is unbelievable. Not only does he fight great, but he also has to move like a blind man. Keanu Reeves is also very impressive. Keanu IS John Wick. Although there are a few scenes where his enemies stand by and wait for their turn to attack, it's easy to overlook because everything else is so great.I can't fathom how anyone could choose to watch Ant-Man over John Wick. It's so fast-paced, and the choreography and stunts are mesmerizing and brutal. When the action breaks out, it's unbelievable. It's hard to explain -- you have to see it!

This is why john wick is the best action action movie franchise of all time; The movies just keep getting better and better. In john wick 4, when the action starts in Osaka Japan, it never let's up despite it's almost 3 hour running time. What I really enjoyed the most about JW4 is the cast of characters. Great villains and allies really keep this movie interesting as john trots the globe for 3 hours. The sound engineering, editing, direction, cinematography are excellent as always. The color schemes throughout this franchise (more john wick 2, 3 and especially 4) are such a treat for the eyeballs. Best action franchise EVER.

From the first second it engages you, no hesitation, no quarter. And it's only the beginning. I read somewhere that a reviewer had said that there wasn't a wasted moment in this film and I watched it questioning the validity. They weren't wrong. Each conversation has a purpose, each scene makes a point. From the gunfight samurai scene in Tokyo to the phosphorus gunfight shot from above in Paris, the action doesn't diminish. Normally a sequel is \"lesser\" but John Wick 4 simply builds onto the quadrilogy. It makes sense, it continues the story and the characters get all the more interesting.I can tell you right now, if the phosphorus gunfight scene doesn't impress you (which it will), the Paris traffic carnage scene is brilliant. I can't say I have ever seen someone do full continuous 360 drifting in a muscle car either :DI know Keanu said that Chad Stahelski and himself were taking a long break from the John Wick series but should we have seen the end, it ended on a note I feel we could live with. If they can find another story that will build onto the John Wick series then so be it but if not, I truly left the movie happy and felt it was done.Don't leave until after the credits are done. Trust me, it's not finished."},{"users":"Andrew_Wiper","ratings":"10","titles":"Adrenaline rush","reviews":"Quite possibly the best action movie of the decade. It's only 2023.

Props to lethal weapon 4 as well. Keanu is a bad ass ok. He moves a little slow in the beginning but by the time the second half comes along he moves like a martial arts madman. That being said.. the nunchucks he incorporates into his character in that first half is brilliant. The set pieces in this are absolutely fantastic. The music is perfectly incorporated as well. There were a few nods to some classic flicks too. Movie buffs will catch them."},{"users":"Holt344","ratings":"10","titles":"John Wick: Chapter 4 offered me 169 minutes of pure entertainment with an exciting cast of characters and action sequences that'll impress anyone, a perfect action film","reviews":"My expectations for John Wick: Chapter 4 was high, these films have become some of my favorite action films of all time, and I can say this without giving it a second thought how it met those expectations. The thugs and easy obstacles are nothing new, except for how they too have ballistic suits like our protagonist. But this Chapter begins with a recovered Baba Yaga who's out for blood. Actors and returning characters along with Keanu Reeves as John Wick is Laurence Fishburne as the Bowery King, Ian McShane as Winston Scott, and Lance Reddick (in one of his final roles) as Charon. New roles which I loved was Donnie Yen as Caine: a blind High Table assassin and an old friend of John Wick.Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as the Marquis Vincent de Gramont: a powerful member of the High Table whose position is challenged by John Wick. Hiroyuki Sanada as Shimazu Koji: the manager of the Osaka Continental Hotel and an old friend of John Wick. It also stars Shamier Anderson, Rina Sawayama and Scott Adkins.The premise goes like this: John Wick uncovers a path to defeating The High Table. But before he can earn his freedom, Wick must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe and forces that turn old friends into foes.Let's dig deeper into the story and what sequences I liked the most, I have a weak spot for samurai movies and the Osaka Continental offers just that. Brilliant choreography for each character, good guys like bad guys. With Hiroyuki Sanada being as brilliant as ever! Also showing off Donnie Yen's retired blind assassin. It's always nice to see a new Continental and this one sure felt special, you notice what friendship John Wick and Shimazu Koji has. The action sequence was great! But my favorite city and action sequences are found in Paris, it has the biggest importance to the story, it brought so many memorable moments. It shows why Keanu Reeves was and is right to lead this franchise. Paris is also the city where Marquis Vincent de Gramont is located and he becomes the highest-ranking member of The High Table during this film. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd holds one of the strongest performances in the film as the Marquis. Keanu Reeves holds the best though, maybe not the best dramatic performance but certainly overall performance as he does his own stunts alongside everything else, and the stunts are incredible. Donnie Yen was great and possibly even one of the best things of the movie, both his knowledge in martial arts but also his character which I loved. The performance that surprised me was Shamier Anderson as the mysterious bounty hunter, it's a great character that they could do so much with and I can easily say the same for Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada's characters. One of the final action sequences was all in a one take, except for a quick cut before moving back to the one take. It was shot with a camera above, letting us see everything happening from above and moving with John Wick as he fires inside an abandoned building.Chad Stahelski truly directed an action film that'll be remembered for decades, his direction in both the action and more dramatic scenes are all brilliant. There's so many fight sequences in this film, small like big, all directed and shot brilliantly. The screenplay was done by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch, I don't have any problem with it, it's good and for a Wick film it holds the same quality. The movies aren't about the best writing in Hollywood, it's about what happens on the screen, blood being spilled. Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard returned to compose the score for the film, after doing so for the previous three films. Like Shay Hatten had done too.I have read various of critics and some people complaining about the length, Chapter 4 has a runtime of 169-minutes. Its long, full of beautiful looking shots that does nothing to the story, only to create atmosphere and suspense where it succeeds. There are scenes that you could easily trim, yes, but I still found the length to be perfect. I want to see the 3 hour 49 minute version just because of how great the film was, but the theatrical version is magnificent. Chapter 4 is all about tying up loose ends, to finally find peace and freedom. It's a long road to that point, Chad uses the film's length for just that, to tell a bigger and deeper story than a simple story. More run time also means for more action sequences!This might be the best film of the four, both action and drama, also most beautiful in regards of the camera work and cinematography. Dan Laustsen truly knows his craft, making each scene absolutely mesmerizing to look at! I loved every second of it, when I saw it at the cinema, a woman (a mother) sat beside the person I was there with and said how brutal it was... She was five minutes in and the first action scene had only just started. Jokes aside, John Wick: Chapter 4 has some of the franchise's best action sequences and Keanu Reeves at his best. Like his role in The Matrix, John \"Baba Yaga\" Wick will be another role he'll be remembered for. This was an incredible film, one of the best I've seen in awhile."},{"users":"jtindahouse","ratings":"9","titles":"THIS is how you justify a 3 hour runtime","reviews":"In a world where movie sequels seem to be loathed even before they are released, the 'John Wick' series has remained remarkably consistent and well received. In fact all three of the first films have the same IMDb rating of 7.4\/10 and I noticed recently that I gave them all the same rating of 8\/10. Incredibly, I think 'John Wick: Chapter 4' is the best the series has to offer. This movie was a wild ride.I was a little disappointed when I first saw the runtime for this one was going to be almost 3 hours. I find that is becoming a tough runtime for a lot of films to justify. This film does it with no trouble. The pacing is so incredibly fast that the 3 hours pass by in no time. I remember looking down at my watch early in the film thinking maybe 20-25 minutes had gone by and almost an hour had already passed.A large reason for this is the action sequences. When an action sequence starts in this film buckle in, because it is going to go for nearly 20-30 minutes and be non-stop craziness the for the duration.The action sequences in this film are perfectly shot as they always are in this series. Lovely, wide camera angles so we can see every thing that happens and know that it isn't all being edited to look this way. These people are actually doing these things.As always with these films you need to go in a rather incredible suspension of belief. Wick is nearing super-human level at this point. It doesn't matter how many cars you hit him with or how high the building he falls off is, he'll be back and fighting again 10 seconds later. It's best to switch your brain off at these points I have found.Finally, I loved the main villain in this movie played excellently by Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd. He was everything a villain should be. Calm and seemingly in control, menacing and easy for the audience to hate and root against.This film was a blast from start to finish. 9\/10."},{"users":"zameerpro","ratings":"9","titles":"Bonjour Monsieur Wick","reviews":"John Wick series have always been over-the-top action \/ thriller joyrides more focused on dazzling you with visceral, expertly choreographed action sequences than trying to tell the most coherent stories about stylish assassins. Director Chad Stahelski's John Wick: Chapter 4 is no exception. And it abundantly delivers on the franchise's hallmarks - snazzy guns, lovable dogs, and one very haggard man in black. John Wick: Chapter 4 isn't a movie you casually sit down to watch apropos of nothing. It's a commitment, both in terms of how long it is and in how invested you really have to be in the idea of John Wick for the film to be engaging. To its credit, John Wick: Chapter 4 does an admirable job of leaving open possibilities for a future filled with stories of some of the movie's new supporting characters. It comes as a pleasant surprise given how much time this story spends trying to remind you that Wick is the baddest man in town. It's a movie that's meant to be watched loud and big. Remember ! John Wick has fought hard for it."},{"users":"Brandon_Walker_Robinson","ratings":"8","titles":"May possibly be the best John Wick, but is absolutely the most John Wick.","reviews":"That lasted 169 minutes? I had no idea. The time just flew right by.Chad Stahelski does not pull any punches (or engage the safety) at any time in this gun-fu epic. Combat scenes are not moments so much as they are entire acts. The amount of stunt choreography that everybody had to synchronize to was rather incredible, and they continue to find more ways to entertain us with kills, kill types, use of weapons, locations, teamwork, etc. I caught myself smiling for minutes on end several times while watching it.Of course though, as I said, they really lean into it. I'm sure this has been true of previous films as well, but it is very apparent that John Wick should virtually die in every scene that he is in. Whether it is how he is attacked or how they fail to attack him at the right times, he goes at every foe like the bear in The Revenant with full adrenaline and no signs of slowing down no matter what he is hit by. And again, I think if you look hard enough you will find enemies who have clear shots and choose not to take them because of plot armor, but you can forgive it enough if you're rewarded with a longer take or overall longer action sequence. What I really loved was how many of these scenes took place at night with dazzlingly lit environments all around, and the music in every scene kicks as much *** as what you see on screen. I had pondered over why John Wick doesn't have a video game yet, but if they ever make one I have decided I'd like one of those top-down shooter games (similar to The Hong Kong Massacre, and if not maybe like the GTA:SA MP rampage style).I acknowledge this franchise for what it is now, but I still pine for some of the missing components that I don't know if it'll ever be able to bring back. After watching John Wick, fun as it was, I found myself interested in seeing a prequel when he was the Baba Yaga in his prime, taking missions rather than being hunted. Even still, at least in that movie he was absolutely feared. In Chapter 2, I still found him heavily respected, but it was in that movie that I realized there would probably be a repetitive formula to the narrative and movie\/action structure (which still has yet to break). In Chapter 3, there only lived assassins and they would go after him without hesitation, which did is not how I felt the world breathed the first time around. They continue down this path in Chapter 4, while opening the universe more to different characters breeding their own kind of loyalty. They are all insanely fun to watch, and you see the cogwheels of the John Wick universe spinning with the future Continental television show and the Ballerina movie spinoff. Where they remain faulty though is even with the existence of civilians during fight scenes, they act as droning NPC's like nothing is happening around them, or they aren't there whatsoever. It is clear that this is not our world that this movie takes place in, but rather a parallel one.I mentioned the introduction of new characters in this world, and you can't not bring up Donnie Yen when talking about them. He steals each and every scene that he is in, and it's crazy because you wonder how a character like his could thrive in such a world but you absolutely believe it when you watch it. I will absolutely take more of him and Rina Sawayama. She isn't featured as much, but she makes use of every second that she is in front of the camera. There are plenty of others (such as the great Hiroyuki Sanada), but the point remains that Wick is relegated to this greater universe with characters who-good, bad, or for themselves-are ones we can actually root for in any fight. Keanu Reeves is understandably less nimble at his age than the others (and it's either bad acting or he really has taken on this John Wick role in his line delivery to hilarious new heights), but he and Stahelski have found a groove that still makes him the most impenetrable force around, to the point that I go back and watch the action scenes in The Matrix Resurrections and wonder what happened there. I didn't love one particular character in their big fighting moment(s), but they go for versatility and I have to give them that much.March has had an incredible run of theatrical films, and John Wick: Chapter 4 is no different. You will lean forward during the action which there is plenty, and if I'm one to go off of you will not feel the runtime. There is an end credits scene as well if you're able to stay for a moment longer. I would love to go back and see this one again."},{"users":"Dominantxx","ratings":"10","titles":"Loving Husband","reviews":"As Mr Wick nears the end of his journey, we are given a delight of a story well structured across its constant world building.

This is a combat magnum opus, a relentless sensory experience, gorgeously hyperviolent, and easily the best in the series.Baba Yaga is, once again, fighting to defeat the High Table while also facing a devilish and powerful new adversary (a disquieting and deviously memorable performance by Bill Skarsg\u00e4rd as Marquis) in death-defying, blood-spurting, neon-blasting, stunts-to-spare, well-groomed, high-fashion style. Yes, the plot is rather simple, straightforward, and lacking in in-depth character background, but that hasn't been the strength of any of the Wick films anyway.The masterful elements at play in \"Chapter 4\" begin with its colorful, even extravagant, and likeable supporting characters including Laurence Fishburne as the crafty Bowery, Clancy Brown as the cryptic Harbinger, Donnie Yen - electrifying as the blind, yet intuitive Caine - and most terrifically, Shamier Anderson as Tracker - a shady spy-like character that gives an indelible performance that ranges from brutal toughness to vulnerable subjugation.Add heart-pounding sound effects and a pulsating musical score, striking nighttime, dark and gritty noir-inspired cinematography, and masterful fighting choreography that frames Wick in different cities with sumptuous vistas across the globe (the locales are outstanding from Sacr\u00e9 Coeur, to Arc de Triomphe, to the Louvre, to the Eiffel Tower in France to the opening scene in Aqaba, Jordan plus Berlin and Tokyo) and you end up with what feels like the most edgy, revolutionary, and most James Bond-esque entry yet.The elaborate and visceral set designs are \"Chapter 4's\" crowning achievement; lavish and rich with detail, they put Wick in elegant and high-tech rooms, ornate buildings, rousing nightclubs, and most memorably, a long flight of stairs and heavily trafficked streets where gut-wrenching, head-popping fighting sequences ensue. It's a WICKedly wild ride from beginning to end that left me breathless, gasping, and exclaiming \"wow!\" in wonderment."},{"users":"masonsaul","ratings":"10","titles":"Action masterpiece","reviews":"John Wick: Chapter 4 is an action masterpiece, an emotionally investing, unashamedly pretentious and extremely satisfying final chapter that continues to celebrate stunt work as the art form it absolutely is and deliver franchise high spectacle that really does put the majority of other action films to shame.Keanu Reeves is even more agile than ever and continues to really impress in the action despite being 4 films in. Once again though, it's not just the action he excels at with the sense of finality this time around adding a sombre and contemplative nature to his performance that is beautiful.The supporting cast is insanely stacked, a definite new record for this franchise. Ian McShane and Lawrence Fishburne play to their familiar strengths and really dial them up. Then there's the newcomers, starting with Shamier Anderson who has a really interesting angle to his character that's a lot of fun.Rina Sawayama makes a terrific screen debut and has great chemistry with Hiroyuki Sanada who can do no wrong and his reunion with Reeves is a joy to see. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd is another memorable villain for this franchise as a character who dresses like a gentleman but acts like the complete opposite.Scott Adkins plays against type in hilarious fashion and then there's Donnie Yen. Obviously he's perfect in the action scenes and just so cool but on top that he's one of the best characters because his conflict with John isn't as black and white as previous antagonists, making it all the more interesting.Chad Stahelski's direction is phenomenal, the action scenes are still super clean and impeccably choreographed. There's a nightclub scene that actually improves over the original, a fight in oncoming traffic that's jaw droppingly good and a one take that is one of the best of all time.The film also offers an excellent reminder that Stahelski is an amazing visual stylist as well. With Dan Laustsen's cinematography he creates a beautifully film that makes each location visually unique and the lighting in particular is just stunning throughout.The pacing is so good, gaining momentum early on and never letting up. The music by Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard is once again incredible, bringing back all the greatest hits without solely relying on them and actually creating the most unique score of the four with plenty of new pieces."},{"users":"neil-476","ratings":"5","titles":"There is such a thing as too much","reviews":"The Table, the international crminal brotherhood which has condemned John Wick empowers The Marquis to deal with him (and the Manager of the New York Continentale Hotel). But maybe, just maybe, there is a way out.As expected, the IMDB is full of people saluting this as \"Best John Wick yet,\" \"A masterpiece,\" \"Best action movie ever,\" etc. My view differs. But I must start by giving credit where it is due. Production design, cinematography, action choreography and direction are all first rate, and they deserved a much better film that this is. And this film deserved a much better script than this.The story is fine, quite good even, but it is buried under industrial quantities of action which defies belief. Everbody's resistance to trauma and the complete absence of police are just the big two, but let's not forget the endless succession of pairs of heavies coming out of nowhere and only stopping when Wick has no gun.And even the scriot deserved a better actor than Keanu Reeves. To be fair, the character in the first film has been reduced to a mere cardboard cutout here, but Reeves (who I genuinely like as a performer) doesn't even play cardboard well here.This is beautifully crafted drivel. 7 for craft, 3 for Reeves' central performance, averages to 5."},{"users":"FlashCallahan","ratings":"9","titles":"Such is life.....","reviews":"John Wick uncovers a path to defeating The High Table, and earning his battered body, a much deserved freedom.But before he can earn his freedom, Wick must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe, and forces that turn old friends into foes......First of all, any film that features Donnie Yen and Scott Adkins is a must for any action film aficionado. But to have them in a John Wick film isn't just a dream come true, it's a work of sheer genius. I've had my expectations high for several films this year, such as Pants Man, Cocaine Bore, and Scream VI, which have all let me down.So I tried to lower my expectations for this, but I couldn't. Because this franchise has just been getter bigger and better with each instalment. And does it meet expectations?Too bloody right it does, it's a masterpiece in set pieces and going above and beyond in pleasing the fans.There are five huge set pieces that are wonderfully staged, and they are brutal and unflinching, and usurp anything from the previous three movies.The first is at Shimazus Continental, and although it goes on for a while, it's breathtaking, reminiscent of the shootout at the end of Parrabellum, but with Yen making good use of an everyday household item, and the icing on the cake for this sequence, Wick using nunchucks. That's all you need to know. Wick using nunchucks.The second features again, Yen, but now we have Scott Adkins thrown in. And for good measure, he's wearing a fat suit. Again, beautifully staged, with Wick suffering badly this time at the hands of Adkins, with a beautiful diegetic piece from Le Castlevania, keeping the tradition of the franchise. If you though a pencil was a good weapon, wait until you see what is used here.Thirdly, and arguably the best, we have a shoot out around the Arc De Triumphe. A ballet of cars and bullets that had me on the edge of my seat. It's so seamless and expertly made, I doubt you'll find a better cinematic action scene this decade. It's that beautiful.Fourthly, we have a wonderful over head long take with Wick taking out bad guys from room to room, using the most unique gun of the series. It's literally a blast.And the most bone crunching and funniest sequence is on the steps leading to the church. It puts The Exorcist to shame.All this clocking in at nearly three hours, and I didn't once find the film bloated or lagging. As for Reeves, he's a movie star. Some of his acting is pretty questionable in the film, but the man has screen presence, and by his performance, he's dedicated to the cause of Wick.What let the side down a little was Skarssgards pantomime portrayal of the villain. He's far too camp to be in the least but threatening, and the 'help' Wick received from the tracker was a little too convenient at times.But minor quibble aside, this is a masterpiece of action, it's balls to the wall from the moment you see the Thunder Road PC logo, right until the fade of the last scene.This is everything you've expected and more. If you are a fan of the action genre, see this, you've deserved it.Look out for a Wilhelm scream, and a stinger.'Chefs Kiss'"},{"users":"MovieRiffing","ratings":"9","titles":"The Boogeyman Is Back for His Bloodiest Outing Yet","reviews":"John Wick: Chapter 4 is the culmination of the entire series and represents the perfection of all of the different ideas and concepts that have been toyed with up until now.

Hence the efficiency and necessity of one or two shots to the cranium. And very little blood, which I don't miss at all, given that, like sex, I don't need more than a glance to get it.As with most cinema, even impossibly successful runs like this thriller juggernaut, it's about storytelling even when it's about beautifully-choreographed fight sequences that mix martial arts with high-end weaponry that includes a \"dragon's breath shotgun\"! The story is as old as movies themselves: global corporate hoodlums, The Table, are after assassin John Wick, a wicked former employee. The rep is the smarmy Marguis (Bill Skarsgard), decked out in three-piece suits, the brighter the better, and cravats louder than Winston's (thank you costume designer Paco Delgado).Wait till you see the wild-ass fight on a lengthy set of Parisian stairs or sit across from Killa (Scott Adkins, a martial arts expert), an almost sumo-sized card dealer. His silver teeth take us back to a memorable menace in the James Bond canon.It's all very stylish, no doubt because of returning director Chad Stahelski's penchant for colorful neo-noir and writers Shay Hatten and Michael Finch's ability to take the fantasy into new\/old motifs such as a duel that Clint Eastwood would approve. They also supply lines like \"Second chances are the refuge of men who fail\" in a film where memorable dialogue is not what the audience expected.Who would expect set pieces such as combat in the Louvre and around the Arc de Triumph? Or better, who has a budget to afford those glories? Well, the producer of one of the most lucrative crime thriller series in cinema history that takes us to Germany, Japan, and France with ease.I can't predict if Keanu Reeves will return, he with a fortune now probably greater than Croesus' (I hear Reeves is generous with his wealth), because one of the great lines from John's Japanese friend, Shimazu ( Hiroyuki Sanada), in this murderous ballet is \"Have you given any thought to how this ends?\"I have, and I hope it returns if it has more of the absurd style and beautiful ballet peppered with dialogue as sharp as the swords that dispatch very sharp baddies.

What exactly is he actually doing, escpecially in this one? In addition to a lack of motivation, Chapter 4 is a remarkable retcon in the sense that John Wick could have ended the hunt for his person way earlier, thus making at least the last two installments redundant.There's plenty of action here, sure, but it has been getting more and more unrealistic, and so you'll be in a situation where your suspension of disbelief says bye-bye, especially when you contrast the growing ridiculousness of the action with John Wick's decreasing vigour.The plot has some toddler level plot holes and contrivances which are really distracting, yes, even in an action no-brainer like this. Keanu Reeves has maybe ten lines of dialogue in the whole movie. The Marquis is a nonsense character, just like Donnie Yen's Caine character. They just appear, but especially in Caine's case you're supposed to be emotional about it because he's basically John Wick's brother from another mother. We just never knew about him. Oh well.This is the definition of a dumb movie for dumb people, and if you just want to enjoy some nice shots and over-the-top action (some of which is really nice) AND love Keanu Reeves, this is your jam.

I won't say the location because I want to give nothing away but I will say in Paris with a lot of traffic !This movie delves into the characters way more than before, we get really good time with the side characters, usually a movie like this would give them 10-15 minutes screen time and kill them while this isn't the case, in the time sense.

For me, it all became a bit too much, the action rapidly becoming too frenetic and over-the-top. By Parabellum (part three), I had had enough.I hoped that the four years between Parabellum and this fourth entry in the franchise had given me a big enough breather that I might be able to find new appreciation for the excessive mayhem. If anything, I found Chapter 4 even more tiresome: the fight scenes, as technically excellent as they are, simply don't know when to quit, and they're even more ridiculous than ever. Wick has been established as a semi-mythical being (Baba Yaga), seemingly impervious to pain and injury, meaning that the character is never in any real peril, which generates zero jeopardy or excitement. If anything, the relentless action scenes result in boredom, being mind-numbingly repetitive and far-fetched (the whopping 2 hours 49 minutes runtime doesn't help).Director Chad Stahelski pushes plausibility way beyond breaking point with a protracted melee amidst the traffic around the Arc De Triomphe that somehow fails to attract the attention of the Paris gendarmerie; an even more dumb scene (in a film packed with dumb scenes) sees nightclub revellers continuing to dance while people are being shot and axed to death all around them. The final act - a duel between John and blind warrior Caine (Donnie Yen) - takes place outside the Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-Coeur de Montmartre at dawn, with not a single tourist or passerby to alert the authorities of what is occurring.I've been known to enjoy comic-book action films that aren't exactly grounded in reality, but John Wick 4 seems to take place in an alternate universe where none of our rules apply. Since very little of what we see in this film can be believed, I definitely don't swallow the idea that John Wick is actually dead at the end (although I sincerely hope he is).Those claiming that this is the best action film ever made have clearly never seen The Raid 2 (or any early John Woo film, or The Night Comes For Us, or Ong-Bak, or Born To Fight, or Eastern Condors or In The Line of Duty IV or.... well, you get the idea)."},{"users":"movie-reviews-uk","ratings":"7","titles":"Does not feel like a 3-hour movie","reviews":"Let's be honest if, by now, you choose to see a \"John Wick\" movie then you know what's coming. Several hours of hyperkinetic, over the top violence with a pounding soundtrack and moody lighting. On this front \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" delivers and then some.There isn't a plot that I can recall but once again our favourite assassin is wrestling with the unseen High Table and the price on his head is increasing faster than post-Covid inflation. So every goon in a suit is out to collect and John has to wade through a tsunami of bodies in order to, well, keep killing people.Clearly there's no logic here as John has no identifiable motive anymore or even an end-goal in mind. Instead he's the main character in a video game and you're watching a Twitch stream of someone talented playing all the way through to the final boss.At one point this characteristic is cemented, in spectacular fashion, when the camera shifts to a top-down view and you get to watch John move from room to room in a bloody spree. It's a fantastic sequence, right down to the spray of blood as henchmen #89 gets shot in the head at close range.So is it a great film? Well yes because \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" plays it straight down the line and sticks religiously to its aesthetic. There are no in-jokes here, in fact there are more grunts than dialog, and the film absolutely believes in itself.

I have to admit that the photography is gorgeous, the locations are wonderful and the action sequences are well coordinated. However I feel that the true identity of this franchise was completely lost with this fourth chapter. The first two movies for me are the best because the stunts look more credible. \"Parabellum\" started to drop in quality, but it was still a solid flick. Here John suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga. Now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a TV show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. I really hope that in the future screenwriters and the director will come up with better ideas, because it is a series with potential and it showed it in the previous chapters, but in this case it just felt pointless and purposeless."},{"users":"soham-21358","ratings":"10","titles":"BEST ACTION MOVIE OF THIS DECADE","reviews":"'Brilliant' word will be an understatement for this film .This is Chad Stahelski's finest piece of work .

That itself is odd considering that John Wick movies are not about story. That is why this whole thing started over the fact that the son of some crime boss killed the dog his late wife gave him. It's a humorous plot that commits to the Franchise's statie of action film plots, but this movie decides to take itself a little more serious than all the others, really focusing on how far Wick has gone down the rabbit hole snice the first film. Surprising but not bad.Then you have the action, done by some of the best in the world. John Wick 4 feels like one of those episodes of the Mandalorian that's not about the Mandalorian at all. Afterall when you have Donnie Yen in the movie you want to make sure he's doing as many cool action sequences as possible, which means that there were a few times in this movie in which John disappears to allow others to shine. Great as far as the action.Also great, Scott Adkins in a fat suit.

It absolutely earns that runtime with action sequences that never once feel repetitive and a plot that is always moving.Every single gloriously carnage-filled set piece introduces unique geography, weaponry, and style to the mix so that every scene is more shocking and thrilling than the last. I can't remember the last time I was so consistently entertained for nearly three straight hours.This time around there are also several new characters introduced, and they're all given much more personality and narrative purpose than anything we've seen before in these films. For the first time in four movies, I actually got invested in the story on multiple levels rather than just being thoroughly entertained by the action.But it must also be acknowledged that this movie is absolutely insane, and is not meant to be taken seriously. John Wick is an invincible man, frequently surviving things no man can possibly survive. If implausibility bothers you, this will be your nightmare.The story does try to dive deeper into the theme of \"actions have consequences, and nobody is immune to consequences\" that was touched upon in the previous movies. I commend them for trying, but it's still done in a far too surface-level way to be impactful. The writers really glossed over some pretty heavy plot points whose consequences should have been explored in greater detail, and because of this, I didn't feel anything I think they wanted me to feel when the film ended.But this is a minor complaint for a movie like this.

Directed by Chad Stahelski, who helmed all the previous films, this sequel continues the story of John Wick's quest for freedom from The High Table, a mysterious organization that rules over the underworld. Along the way, he faces new enemies and allies, as well as old friends and foes.The movie is a feast for action fans, as it showcases some of the most impressive and inventive fight scenes ever put on screen. From gunfights to knife fights, from car chases to horse chases, from Paris to Tokyo, John Wick: Chapter 4 never lets up on the adrenaline and excitement. Keanu Reeves once again proves his dedication and skill as an action star, performing most of his own stunts and delivering his trademark deadpan humor.The movie also deepens its mythology, exploring more aspects of The High Table's history and hierarchy. We learn more about John Wick's past and his connection to other characters in this world. We also meet new faces that add more flavor and diversity to the franchise. Donnie Yen plays Caine, a fellow assassin who shares a bond with John Wick. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd plays Marquis, a mysterious figure who has ties to The High Table. Hiroyuki Sanada plays Shimazu, a ruthless leader of a Japanese crime syndicate.The movie is not without its flaws, however. At nearly three hours long, it feels bloated and overstuffed at times. Some scenes drag on for too long or feel unnecessary. Some plot points are confusing or underdeveloped. Some characters are underused or wasted. The movie also relies heavily on fan service and references to previous films, which may alienate newcomers or casual viewers.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a satisfying conclusion (or is it?) to one of the best action franchises of recent years. It delivers more of what fans love about this series: stunning action sequences, cool visuals, charismatic performances, and intriguing lore. It also leaves room for more potential stories in this universe."},{"users":"rupali-38827","ratings":"4","titles":"Damp Wick","reviews":"No idea how the ratings are as high as they are.

They may have well cut the scenes directly from the Warriors. Better film, done better and that isn't a great film. For those of you who have never heard of the Warriors, go watch it.

I'm writing this review in the early hours after midnight as the film went on for a good whopping 2 hours & 39 minutes!! But we'll get to that in a bit...! Anyway, I was looking forward to this film since John Wick 3's release back in 2019 & this film has had a bit of a troubled history of getting pushed back until it finally got its March 2023 release. I must admit I was a bit skeptical, but, was looking forward to this as the John Wick films are ace, but this film was a bitter disappointment...!The film sees John Wick, who from the events of the last film, has a price on his head which is increasing more than ever. The lethal unstoppable force of nature assassin now must fight against the High Table Global as he seeks out & fights the most deadly assassins players of the underworld from Paris to New York to Berlin to Japan. Will John Wick finally meet his match!?Whoa...! Where do I start!? I found the film for starters to be too long!! At a whopping 2 hours & 39 minutes this film is way, way, way too long! The pacing... whoa! Don't get me started! I was willing to be tolerant & forgive the pacing, but when it got to the final leg it took the absolute puss & started to test my nerves! The story is so weak I had to look this film up in order to get what the plot was, again, another sign that the film was going to be bad, the first was the runtime, which I knew was going to be bad from the word go!The film took a while to get going which was a pain, but it got there I guess! The fights were good, as with the John Wick films typically are, not to mention funny & brutal! But all things considered, it got repetitive fast & annoying especially near the end as I just mentioned! The story scenes were alright as with the villains & bad guys though again, it got repetitive & irritating.The realism was stretch beyond its limits here in this film. John Wick fell from a great height on a metal pipe which looked to have (& lets be honest here) would've snapped his back like a tooth pick! John got hit by a car 5 times yet never suffers any bad injuries or dies! Yet a few bullet wounds finally kill him at the end (another downer of this film which I'll touch up on in a second!), the fight scenes in the night club where only a few people stood there shocked while about 95% just kept on dancing! Face palm! There were several other scenes which made you just think \"dafuq!?\"The lead up to the end was annoying! Just when you thought John Wick was going to go to the Stand Off with the blind villain, there was more fight scenes! Don't get me wrong, these fights where good, but annoying & held the film up for a good 20 minutes before the finale which to say the least, was anti climatic! The scene on the 122 steps was irritating & made you just scoffs in frustration when John got kicked down those steps which for a couple of seconds in its self, dragged & felt & looked comical! It's like getting so far in a mission in Grand Theft Auto V then dying & reverting back to the latest checkpoint where you have to start all, over, again!! The same feelings of that (from experience) where felt for me in this film from that scene!Then of course, after John Wick killing 180 odd people (or more, I lost count obviously) he finally dies! What!? Like James Bond in that god awful Bond Film of 2021 No Time To Die!? Can't be!? What a poor show! Anyhow, to give you guys some perspective on how long this is in comparison to the rest of the films in the franchise! Without credits as they don't count!John Wick (2015) - 1 hour 30 minutes"},{"users":"A7medSalah","ratings":"9","titles":"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","reviews":"As thrilling and relentless as any action movie before it, John Wick: Chapter 4 is an adrenaline injection with Oscar worthy stunt work, assured direction and Keanu Reeves as magnetic as ever. The best Chapter yet...John Wick: Chapter 4 feels like a film where Director Chad Stahelski understood that he finally had the freedom and the budget to do, literally, anything he wanted on the screen-and might never again-so by God, he was going to do it.With characters able to dodge bullets left, right and centre, the film is a homage to the classic martial-arts genre with a sprinkling of old Hollywood Westerns where protagonists never seem to run out of ammunition or ways to stay alive.The movie also deepens its mythology, exploring more aspects of The High Table's history and hierarchy. We learn more about John Wick's past and his connection to other characters in this world. We also meet new faces that add more flavor and diversity to the franchise. Donnie Yen plays Caine, a fellow assassin who shares a bond with John Wick. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd plays Marquis, a mysterious figure who has ties to The High Table. Hiroyuki Sanada plays Shimazu, a ruthless leader of a Japanese crime syndicate.Donnie Yen brings not only his skills as one of the finest martial arts movie stars in the world, but lends his presence as a charismatic and riveting figure. He plays the role of Caine with complexity and humanity that is a terrific mirror to Reeves' Wick; his friend and adversary by circumstance. This was a fantastic choice to take the Wick series to a new level.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a satisfying conclusion (or is it?) to one of the best action franchises of recent years. It delivers more of what fans love about this series: stunning action sequences, cool visuals, charismatic performances, and intriguing lore. It also leaves room for more potential stories in this universe."},{"users":"imseeg","ratings":"5","titles":"I feared the worst, but it was better than I expected, although not near as good as the original.","reviews":"The bad: it lasts too long. A whopping 2 hours and 45 minutes. Some of the fighting scenes stretch out over 5 to 15 minutes of CONTINEOUS fighting. But after having watched over 2 hours of fighting already, I definitely began to long for it to end.The good: the fighting scenes are pretty good though. I was wondering if they could still come up with some new and interesting fighting choreography and they succeeded at that quite well. There are even quite a few comical fighting stunts included. Nice!All in all not a bad sequel. If it werent for the much TOO long duration I would rate this nr 4 sequel better \/ higher as the nr 3 edition.Nothing beats the original first edition of John Wick though, because THAT first edition was not only contineous action but also cared about the CHARACTERS. Unfortunately all the sequels were more and more focussed on solely the figthing scenes, which kinda bored me in the end.Nr 4 is highly overrated. I suspect because of artificial \"managing\" of the Imdb ratings. This movie is never worthy of 8 stars (ridiculous). 6 stars at best. But because I got bored at the end I will only rate it 5 stars..."},{"users":"codytheway","ratings":"4","titles":"Everyone here has drank the Kool-Aid","reviews":"Listen, this movie was far from as good as the others and had very little realism to it compared to the others. Numerous times John falls from like 4 stories up and gets up and walks it off. He also gets hit by cars numerous times and simply just walks it off. He also falls down 222 steps and gets up and walks it off. Where is the realism here?Also, the acting was incredibly bad. Like really really bad. Laurence Fishborne going over the top and Keanu not saying much, but when he does he makes himself sound like he's having a stroke.Adding the black assassin dude simply as the diversity hire was a weird choice. Like seriously, he was the only black dude. The dude was a complete wild card that you had no idea whose side he was on. He was trying to kill John, but also trying to save him? Also, he had a dog to help him. Didn't Halle Berry have the exact same gimmick in the last movie that did the same trick of going for the nuts?And where was John's motivation for all of this? Why was he in Japan? Why did he kill the High Table person? Why wasn't this Marques person introduced sooner? Why was a blind assassin 20x better than any of the other assassins? And lastly, why did John go through allllll of that crap just to die at the end? To protect Winston? The dude who shot him off roof?Overall, there was only a couple of good parts to the movie. Nothing that the other 3 movies hadn't done before."},{"users":"navendu_krishnan","ratings":"6","titles":"Unpopular Opinion - John Wick 4 is a below average movie.","reviews":"Unpopular Opinion - John Wick 4 is a below average movie.I loved all 3 John wick movies, but this one is more likely a conclusion of John wick series, So the fight scenes are boring and repetitive.

Once again directed by Chad Stahleski and starring Keanu Reeves in the title role, it stands out as not only the best film in the series but also as one of the very best action films made in recent decades.Shortly after the events of the third film, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is in the planning stages of taking down the powerful High Table once and for all. After executing the Elder (George Georgiou), a man ranked above the High Table, John travels to Osaka to seek refuge in their local Continental Hotel. While there, John learns from the manager that his old blind friend Caine (Donnie Yen) and a bounty hunter known only as \"Mr. Nobody\" (Shamier Anderson) have each been ordered to assassinate him by a High Table member named Marquis Vincent de Gramont (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd). As he fights off various other assassins, John eventually meets up with New York's Continental manager Winston Scott (Ian McShane), who may hold the key to disbanding the High Table permanently.Almost a decade since its debut, the \"John Wick\" series has cemented itself as one of the most popular action film franchises to ever grace movie theatres. The films are known for their highly stylised action scenes, memorable supporting characters, and intriguing world building elements that always make audiences come back for more. At the centre of it all is of course Keanu Reeves, who has helped the titular character become one of the most recognisable action heroes of all time. Now four films in, you would expect the series to show signs of losing some steam but \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" proves all doubters wrong with an exhilarating action-packed experience that leaves other similar films in the dust.Now that he's \"excommunicado\", the stakes are at an all time high as we see John facing off against even more dangerous adversaries than before. Anybody who's watched these films since the beginning will know that John's worldwide infamy makes it increasingly difficult for him to find allies willing to assist, especially considering how the bounty on his head keeps rising with every powerful enemy he makes. Because of that, there's more tension this time around than in previous entries, allowing less room for error at the risk of sudden death. Most of the time, John relies solely on his own wit and ingenuity to take out his enemies, whether it's with his simple handgun or with any part of the surrounding environment. John is a resourceful assassin, not blinding shooting at any moving target but instead calculating the right time and technique to take out a particular foe, no matter how minor. It is this trait that separates a character like John Wick from the rest of the typical action heroes, as contemplating his next move is what has made him so interesting to watch over the past four films.Something else I've admired about \"John Wick\" series is the attention-to-detail that goes into virtually every scene. Regardless of where things are taking place, there's so much visual beauty and creativity on display in each shot. This film is certainly no exception as it contains some truly breathtaking cinematography that places the audience right at the forefront of the action. If these scenes don't rejuvenate you, then you probably have no pulse. From the brightly coloured neon lights of Osaka to the raving nightlife of Berlin, every location oozes so much personality that they almost become characters in their own right. It is in these places that some of the best choreographed, best edited, and best filmed fight scenes in recent memory are able to firmly establish this fourth entry as one of the most exciting action films to ever be released in theatres. Yet despite all the frenetic shoot-outs and hand-to-hand combat, they are all handled with such careful precision that it is still easy to follow everything happening without losing focus of who is fighting who. And to top it all off, at no point is shaky cam ever used during the action scenes, which makes these already entertaining segments even better.For someone approaching his 60s, Keanu Reeves shows absolutely no signs of slowing down in the iconic lead role. Every shot that he fires, every punch that he throws, and every sword that he swings proves that Reeves can still hold his own alongside any younger cast members. There were even times where I couldn't help but notice some of the other supporting cast struggling to keep up with Reeves, which helped make him stand out quite considerably. Although the character of John Wick has never really had a huge amount of depth behind him, he definitely has a level of intrigue, something I think Reeves is able to play into perfectly. He is man of few words, whose widespread notoriety and respect from other assassins combined with his compassion for the defenseless makes him an endearing hero for the audience to cheer for. After all, it's easy to care about somebody who has risked everything to avenge the death of his dog.Additionally, I don't think the film would have worked half as well without John's two worthy opponents - Donnie Yen as Caine and Shamier Anderson as Mr. Nobody. Yen's depiction of Caine draws comparisons to that of Marvel's Daredevil, in that he is blind but a highly skilled martial artist relying on his other senses to defeat enemies. Caine's proficiency in combat is so unparalleled that each time I saw him fight I kept forgetting about his blindness since his reflexes are so unusually fast. However, what I liked most was the mutual respect between him and John, being that they were once close friends in the past. On the other hand, Mr. Nobody is completely different as he has no personal connection to John. He is only doing this job for the money but along the way he learns that John is a force to be reckoned with. It is interesting to watch how Mr. Nobody learns more about John as the film progresses, and Anderson successfully brings out all the necessary layers of curiosity surrounding his character.Even after four movies, the \"John Wick\" series is still as impactful as it was when it first started, with each film being better than the last. What began as a relatively straightforward story of a man seeking revenge against those who killed his dog is now a multi-layered, action-packed, and beautifully shot set of films that exists within its own meticulously crafted world. This fourth film has not only helped redefine the series as a whole but also what action movies are capable of in general. Personally, I would love to see another \"John Wick\" film but according to director Chad Stahleski, this will be the last one for a while with the spin-off film \"Ballerina\" and miniseries \"The Continental\" coming soon to fill the void in the meantime. Either way, it looks like this series is here to stay.I rate it a solid 9\/10."},{"users":"radhrh","ratings":"3","titles":"Becoming boring now.","reviews":"Just how much cash can you get out of a cash cow? As the John Wick producers know that's plenty of dough but with each iteration the movies become ever more flabby and contrived. The Hollywood formula has been employed; copy a previous success adding ever more crash bang and wollop and of course stretching the whole thing out to a dreary 3 hour run time. But of course Hollywood misses the point, yet again. What made the original Wick movie interesting was the character's struggle to make a new life only to be dragged back into the criminal underworld. Granted it's an interesting and novel criminal underworld but now it's the world of John Wick which is the focus, not Wick himself. Time to call it a day."},{"users":"MatthewMichaelHoffman","ratings":"7","titles":"Best Action Movie ever with an atrocious story","reviews":"SCORE: 7.2\/10The biggest roller coaster of roller coasters I've ever been on while watching a movie in theaters. It was good, then it was bad, then it was great, then boring, then absolutely amazing, then disappointing. If we are speaking solely about the Action, this was the greatest Action movie of all time. Every fight was legendary and the new tricks and weapons they used were unlike anything I've ever seen before. The exploding shotgun, the ultra-realistic fighting choreography, and the entire world getting bossed up by Mr. Wick. If the movie were just all of the fight scenes mashed together, this may have been a perfect movie. However, unfortunately, as movies tend to go, there also happens to be a story element to them. And for John Wick 4, it was atrocious and easily the worst story in the franchise.Anytime the new villain was on screen it was a complete snooze fest, apart from the end where he gets a bullet in the head. Some of those scenes went on way too long and made some of the Action scenes less impactful because of what we had to go through to get there. I was excited when I saw the 2hr and 49 minute runtime, as I loved the first 3 John Wicks, but this movie had no business being that long. So much of it should've been cut out. There was way too much plot armor given to the head of security for the High Table and the guy he meets the card table, which made it felt forced at times. I have no problem with all the plot armor given to John Wick, but I was not a fan of those other characters being portrayed in that way.Now for the 2 most problematic parts of the movie. For one, can they make up their mind when it comes to the relationship between John and Caine and the Tracker? They're fighting against each other and then working together and then fighting against each other and then working together and then half fighting against each other and half working together. It felt sloppy and inconsistent in a way that was not productive. Lastly, HE DIES? You have got to be kidding me. It's not just the fact that he dies, but it's the way it happens. Granted, there is probably a 99% chance he's still alive, but absolutely nothing in his final conversation with Caine and Winston made me thinking he was dying. And now he just collapses over on the stairs and it cuts to his tombstone? For everything he was able to endure throughout the 4 films, it was a pretty pathetic way to end the movie and it felt like a slap in the face. John Wick deserved way better. We also still got virtually nothing about his wife apart from a single flashback, an element that should've been explored by now.This movie review is long because I'm very passionate about John Wick and I love his character and the movies that came before this one. To end on a positive note, there were still a bunch of good things that happened in this film that were just unfortunately watered down by the length of the film and the rest of the story. The humor was phenomenal, both Caine and the Tracker's character were great additions, and there were a lot of high impact scenes, such as John saving the Tracker's dog. Lastly, RIP to the legend Lance Reddick. I know he didn't have a major part in this movie, but he has given a memorable performance in each of the prior movies and was so talented. Taken from us way too soon."},{"users":"spotboyfilms","ratings":"10","titles":"Solid Addition to the Franchise","reviews":"Parabellum (part 3) was my favorite and as is the case in many sequels, hard to keep topping your last go- not in the case of the John Wick team.

John Wick 4 was an absolute pleasure to watch. It was full of entertainment. Despite being almost 3 hours long, it does not have boring sections. The non-action scenes have interesting characters, drama and incredible production design. John Wick continues to raise its own bar.

In fact John was barely in the first half hour of the movie which I was surprised by but it was a very welcome change of pace.The action sequences are bigger and better than we have ever seen before, they've always managed to top themselves movie to movie and Chapter 4 is no different.But the absolute standout action sequence for me is in this abandoned French home in the third act of the film. It was fantastically choreographed, and the camera work was phenomenal and truly unique. Whatever the camera crew is making its not enough.Some certain issues for me, where as I didn't feel the run time for the most part I did begin to feel fatigue during an action sequence in the third act. It felt prolonged to me and I just wanted to move forward with things. But the movie never felt to have dragged and was entertaining and engaging through its entire run time.Lastly I would like to say some words about the recently passed Lance Riddick. While his character Charon was small, his impact was anything but small. The John Wick world, and The Continental Hotel will not be the same without it's courteous and always professional concierge, he will be missed!

What is good with a longer duration is the characters can be well developed, and I really like that Donnie Yen, Shamir Anderson, Hiroyuki Sanada and Scott Adkins have enough time to show their acting. Especially Donnie and Scott. Hiroyuki\/Henry Sanada has seriously acted on several movies so he's natural.Another benefit with longer duration is of course more actions! However, I'm a bit dissapointed about this, because it doesn't mean that to make it longer, those henchmen should be too hard too kill as if they were zombies which you need to punch, kick, throw, shot on the knee, leg, abdomen, chest and finally their head to finally died. For those troops with full body armor (in Continental hotel set) this is still logical. But for those thugs in Paris who were not use a bulletproof suits, this become silly. I don't understand why John Wick didnt try to break their neck or shot their heads to quickly eliminate them.Not only those thugs are zombies, John Wick should also a zombie since he fell from 2nd\/3rd floor several times, get stabbed, punched kicked, hit by car also several time, fall down and roll over on hundreds of steps and still can get up and seems fine.And I totally loss it when there's a shooting duel, with one of the participant is blind!.

It's the ultimate visual feast of blood, bullets and magic, yes magic, read on.It started with JW getting out of the situation alive (again) after falling off the top of hotel continental and continue to rid the world of fellow hitmen (yeah why were there no hitwemen, just wondering).Except that he gets a partner this time, no one else but Ip Man himself, or maybe Zatoichi, yeah more like Zatoichi with eyes can't see, and a cane sword (sword cane)? And aptly named 'Cane'. Except that Cane kills him at the end, anyway that's not important.What's important is, the action! The action is over the top (not that the first 3 wasn't over the top, but this time it's over the topmost of the previous tops), so normally JW uses the ground as his weapon, now he uses cars as well, and stairs.Damn I would hate these stairs, especially when you just finished climbing up 20 flights of stairs and got kicked back to the very begining of it. But they do act as effective weapons when you toss the body of your enemies on top the stairs.And the magic!First of all, the fantastic animal, this time, in a dog form, who listens to her emotional support companion (the tracer)'s commands, and acts accordingly. Honestly I think she needs anger management that's why she has an emotional support human for her.Then there's the weapon that shoots fireballs and light up anything they touch - just like in the games - yeah also top down view, reminds me of the orginal psx grand theft auto, but way more fancier. Heck even the ragdoll movements of the bodies were just so ... identical. I totally enjoyed that.That's 2 and half hours total enjoyment without a break - don't drink too much water before or during the movie and you can thank me later.Now, why only 8 points?Well, also the action - they must have changed the action director cos this time the enemies don't swarm JW anymore, they wait, like civialised citizens, they take turns to hit him, and only when the first one is down the second one will join, there was no rush at all. So yeah I have to take 2 stars off for that reason.Overall, very enjoyable and certainly will get the bluray when it comes out (yes I have the first 3 on 4k bluray).Don't let your kids watch it, they might get the wrong idea like wow I can be that strong and take on the world by myself.No son, you can't, you are more likely to get a bullet through your brain, don't try that."},{"users":"waltermwilliams","ratings":"7","titles":"What Walt's Watching","reviews":"More talk of High Tables blah, blah, blah let's get on with the action!There is plenty of that in \"John Wick: Chapter 4\".This was only meant to be a trilogy, but who can argue a 4th chapter when your franchise is a license to print money?Keanu Reeves is back as John Wick of course and even shares what eulogy he'd like on his tombstone when and if that day comes.Also accompanying him is Ian McShane as \"Winston\" The Manger of the Continental Hotel. That sliver in New York.Its concierge is still Lance Reddick as \"Charon\".The wonderful actor and voice actor who died recently at age 60, which makes his appearance even sadder.The villain of this instalment is one of modern cinemas finest, Bill Skarsgard as \"Marquis\".If you loved him as \"Pennywise\" in \"IT\" just wait to see if the balloons all float down here too in Wickland.Hiroyuki Sanada is a fine actor who heads up the Osaka Hotel in Japan as \"Shimazu\" where some of the best action takes place.Plus of course Lawrence Fishburne as the \"Bowery King\" and tailor to Johnathon...especially the 42 regular Kevlar suit.Donnie Yen is back as \"Caine\".Proving even a blind man can tell when he's walking in the Sun or shooting bad guys using door bells.Shamier Anderson is \"The Tracker\" or \"Mr Nobody\" who with the help of his faithful killer dog takes care of business as a gun for hire.Clancy Brown with his marvellous bass\/baritone voice is \"The Harbinger\" of mostly bad news.One unbelievable death defying fight scene after another plays out during the longest \"John Wick\" chapter ever at 2hrs 49 minutes...especially considering this movie was designed to be seen on IMAX screens where times should be much shorter.Watch out for: The Arc de Triomphe car chase battle scene and the 200 plus stairs fight.The sound engineering is first class with a great soundtrack.You simply have to throw logic out the door to fully comprehend what's happening on the big screen and just enjoy the ride.It's a thriller and possibly one of the best in this saga that started in 2014.Maybe \"John Wicks\" farewell tour is finally coming to an end.Keanu at 59 is still being excellent to his mates and proving deadly to his enemies, but even Wick can't kill everyone."},{"users":"saimariejohnson","ratings":"10","titles":"SPECTACULAR.","reviews":"This chapter of JW was really amazing; action-packed, compelling, funny and star-filled.

While every film in this franchise has been absolutely great, John Wick: Chapter 4 has changed the action genre in films as we know it, bringing everything it could possibly give us to the franchise and more. This movie had action and stunts that I never thought could be possible until viewing this movie and it did not disappoint. After taking a hard hit and recovering from the events of John Wick: Chapter 3 Parabellum, Keanu Reeves returns once again as John Wick to take down any assassin that comes his way and put a end to the manhunt against him by challenging a lead member of the high table to a duel that will either earn him his freedom or could be the end of the Boogeyman. The antagonist in this film Marquis de Gramont played by Bill Skarsgard is absolutely menacing in this role, while bringing us not only a antagonist the franchise hasn't seen before, but also unlike any character Bill Skarsgard has played before. Out of all the newest cast members to come to this film, Donnie Yen was a absolute standout as Caine, a blind assassin and old acquaintance of John Wick's whose ordered by Marquis to hunt him down or suffer the consequences. Shimazu played by Hiroyuki Sanada I also thought was a great addition to the cast after seeing his performance in Bullet Train. The character I was not expecting to like that I thought was also a highlight of the film was Tracker played by Shamier Anderson. He was probably one of my favorite characters to come to the franchise and I hope we see him again in the John Wick Universe in the future. I was glad to see Lawrence Fishburne's Bowery King return as well as Ian McShane's Winston. I was also very happy to see Lance Reddick return one last time as Charon after his sudden passing right before the release of the film. He may of not have had a lot of screentime, but the last scene he was in I felt was closure for not only Lance Reddick, but his character as well. There is no doubt in my mind that this film will go down in history as one of the greatest action films of all time. John Wick: Chapter 4 is hands down one of the most action packed I've ever seen, while also being one of the best I've seen in a long time that was made carefully with the end result being one of the best action film to be released in the past decade.

I'll start by saying the action sequences (all 9,000 of them) are breathtakingly choreographed. John Wick's trademarked 'GunFu' is on full display in Chapter 4 (for better or worse). This chapter easily has the highest body count out of the series, but you can't rely on bodies and bullets as your main focal point, especially if it's supposedly the last chapter (I highly doubt it is). Wick is weighed down by plot armor so thick it deflects literally everything, including the viewer's belief that Mr. Wick will ever be in any danger. Hit by 10 cars? Tis but a scratch!My main issue with Chapter 4 is that the plot is very thin and it's stretched out over 3 hours. This chapter is very 'Beginning. Middle. End'. The beginning and end are 5 minutes a piece, while the middle is two and a half hours of John effortlessly walking through goons (which is great, until it's not). I love me some Wick slaughtering goons, but when 95% of the movie is gun fire, you begin to forget what the plot even is, what the movie's even about, which is not good. This movie could've easily been cut down to 2 hours if they edited the fight scenes to a reasonable time, so I hope you don't like plot with your action.Another gripe I had is the fact that John Wick had like maybe 10 lines of dialogue? The guy barely spoke a word throughout the entirety of the movie, and when he did speak, 99% of the time it was him going \"Yeah...\" (which is great, until it's not). Maybe use Keanu\/Wick as a vehicle for the plot instead of having him be a mute protagonist of an FPS video game? He's the title character for God sake! In Chapters 1 and 2, Wick showed a lot of emotion and vulnerability through dialogue and acting (at least more than this chapter) to express himself, but in this he is pretty much the Doomslayer. Also, is it just me or was Keanu's acting extra bad in this one? The line delivery sometimes was just... oof, even for Keanu standards.My favorite part of the movie is a top-down one-take scene near the end where Wick is blasting through goons with incendiary ammo.Overall, the movie is a good time and if you're a Wick fan, then you won't be disappointed. I'd say this is a step up from Chapter 3, but not as good as 1 and 2.7.2\/10."},{"users":"rexmatthewj","ratings":"10","titles":"GOODBYE JOHN","reviews":"\"John Wick: Chapter 4\" is a thrilling and satisfying fourth installment and continuation of the popular neo-noir action franchise \"John Wick.\" The film delivers on its promises of high-octane action, stunning visuals, and compelling characters, starring Keanu Reeves as the titular assassin seeking vengeance against those who wronged him.

It was worth the wait, combining the mythology-heavy approach of the last couple chapters with the streamlined action of the first film, resulting in a final hour that is among the best of the genre. John Wick: Chapter 4 opens with Wick (Reeves) on the run from the villainous Powers That Be known as the High Table. The main villain of the series is the Marquis de Gramont (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd), a leader of the High Table who keeps raising the bounty on Wick's head while he also cleans up the messes left behind. The opening scenes take Wick to Japan, where he seeks help from the head of the Osaka Continental, Shimazu (Hiroyuki Sanada), and runs afoul of a blind High Table assassin named Caine (Donnie Yen). Laurence Fishburne pops up as Wick's Q when the killer needs a new bulletproof suit, and Shamier Anderson plays an assassin waiting for the price to hit the right level for him to get his payday. Despite the movie's epic runtime (169 minutes), the plot feels refreshingly focused again. The only minor flaw in Wick's armor is a bit of narrative self-indulgence, but fans won't care. This is a movie that should be seen with a cheering, excited crowd, as it has that contagious energy and is meant to be watched loud and big. John Wick has fought hard for it. The stunts and fight choreography of John Wick are top tier, and the director, Chad Stahelski, got his start in the movie industry as a stuntman.\"John Wick: Chapter 4\" is by far the best of the four films starring Keanu Reeves as the eponymous hit man. It has many of the same problems as its predecessors, but something happens late in the game that converts the film's merely technical displays of bloody murder into something suspenseful and romantic. Director Chad Stahelski reteams with key crew, including production designer Kevin Kavanaugh, and there's fresh blood in the cast, most notably Donnie Yen as blind assassin Caine and Scott Adkins as Killa, a murderous plus-sized German equipped with metal teeth. The details are too good to give away, but there's no harm and much pleasure in considering how the movie climbs to that light-headed summit. The movie reprises the basic structure of past films, with Wick (Keanu Reeves) slicing his way through the henchmen of his former employers, the High Table. The stunt work is spectacular, with human bodies being hurled into moving vehicles and Reeves's double tumbling down the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur stairs. Stahelski also delivers one extended, mind-bogglingly complicated fight sequence in a single shot, the camera floating overhead.

The sequences, the shots without a cut, the long sequences of fights was spectacular and really brutal. I enjoyed also the music during the fights and really put a nice rythm to the fights and give dynamics and nervosity. Also the set design from Osaka to Paris was gorgeous and had so many small details that i couldnt keep my eyes off the screen. We had also the story who introduced the new vilain who supposed to be French and was pretty convincing. We have also some interesting discoveries all along during the movie (the blind man who have his daughter in hostage, the way to put an end to all this and to recover the status of the guy in charge of the continental who get destroyed in the movie. The fights feel great even if we know that match a certain choregraphy and dont reflect a real fight but it was well made and have some interesting shots (when at the end they all tried to kill Wick in the building and the camera shot from above all the scene and transform it like a mini map). Some scenes really look gorgeous and awesome and like i said i saw so many action movies but this one was really different; even in the work of the lights and how they put the lights to create a certain tone. It was pretty effective and sometimes some scenes was pretty funny (with the dog). The end is pretty sad and thought that John Wick will made it trough all that but he died. The Caine Character have an interesting style: the way he fights, but i think it was not necessary to make him blind because some scenes lack of logic sometimes and questions us to the believable situations that dont feel believable sometimes(the fights, the fact that nobody had the idea to shot him in the head quickly)but it was ok and give a new opponent\/friend to John Wick in this episode. Give it a try. The actions scenes (because its mostly an action movie)was pretty awesome (Arc de Triomphe, Osaka, sacr\u00e9 coeur). And make it memorable and its one of my favorite John Wick and maybe favorite action movies for now? But it was awesome really. And even some dialogues was well written and some meaningful moments. The story was good for an avtion movie but its certainly not the most interesting part in the movie for sure even if it have some interesting moments and revelations and surprises( i didnt expect the death of the concierge so quickly in the movie to be honest).

Who cares right? Certainly not reviewers and critics who are giving this cartoonish movie high praise. But why stop there? Let's let him get hit by no less than 4 moving cars that would have shattered bones in a mere mortal. But let's go for more. Let's drop him not once but twice down hundreds of stairs only for him to get up and kill dozens more. My wife ( having loved the first 3 ) was thoroughly disgusted with this movie and I was quite dismayed myself. Wick peaked in the second brilliant one but they turned this into a stupid Fast and Furious movie defying what punishment a body can take. Wick is not hurt once except in the final gun battle.

Laurence Fishburne and Ian McShane, who both appeared in previous films, continue to deliver excellent performances, and their characters' interactions with John Wick are always a joy to watch.The music in John Wick 4 is yet another aspect that deserves praise. Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard once again provide a score that perfectly complements the action on screen. The music builds tension and excitement, and it enhances the overall experience of watching the movie.Of course, as with any action movie, there are some flaws. The plot can be convoluted at times, and some of the characters' motivations may not be entirely clear. However, these issues are easily forgiven in light of the incredible action and performances.In conclusion, John Wick 4 is the ultimate action sequel. Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, and Lance Reddick all deliver outstanding performances, and the stunts, direction, and music all contribute to making this movie a must-see for action fans. The franchise continues to raise the bar for what an action movie can be, and John Wick 4 is no exception. If you're looking for a thrilling and entertaining ride, then don't miss this movie."},{"users":"wwwbethwtmata","ratings":"10","titles":"perfect","reviews":"He should set an example for the rest of the action films, as John Wick's character is not an ordinary character.

They have great capabilities, and we do not forget the sound and other effectsWe waited for John Wick for a long time, just waiting for the showtime in Iraq cinema, to feel alive thanks to this elephant.

For the last 3 Wicks, every decision just brought him back to square one. Its an endless loop. A writers nightmare when you dont have a story that progresses.Where this really shines is the cinematography, and fight choreography. Stunning work by the everyone on the crew. Pretty amazing the type shots they were able to get in and had some really good one shots. The fights scenes are awesome but just kinda got old when the movie is nearly 3 hours long.Entertaining film... would def say it was worth the money."},{"users":"statuskuo","ratings":"4","titles":"Sound And Fury Adds Up To Nothing","reviews":"Sitting through the nearly 3 hours of this opus, I can't say that I didn't get my money's worth. But the ride was so bombastic, dark and mumbly that at a certain point it was like being stuck on a roller coaster ride that I've gone through 10 times and gradually sunk deeper and deeper into my chair.What is this movie about? Long were the days of the original John Wick, where it felt nicely paced. A short film extended into a feature but still retained an independent film vibe. Those days are gone. When the original Wick came out, they kept it simple...man seeks revenge on some punks who killed his dog given to him from dead wife. That plot alone is laughably simple. Yet it worked. Perhaps it was the zeitgeist at the time. But this series falls into the VERY same trap they all do. Bigger everything. And that wasn't the case. The Table is a mysterious group that had slick lingo with caricatures of other movies that made you feel something familiar. The call center with its tattoo'd Betties seemed so out of a Jean Pierre Jeunet film like \"City Of Lost Children\" It was unique in the sense that it embraced its steam punk comic book feel. Then it imploded into ridiculous feats of inhuman strength. And a total lack of logic. Police apparently don't exist in John Wick Paris. Ugh.Also, the stunts are great but after (I would calculate) an hour of the same aerobatics, leg locks, tosses and gun shot to head, I grew tired. Made me want to scream to move on. Yes, it has a visceral release to a general audience (I heard a few in my theater clap with approval. But also consider there was one mentally challenged one in a wheel-chair, the other was an elderly lady who was talking through the movie). The original Wick made you really feel the pain of its villains. And made it satisfying. Here, when he goes room to room sweeping with a fire launching shotgun, I wanted to REALLY cheer. It felt flat. Well done, but something was missing. That's what this entire movie felt like. Something missing. Keanu is obviously an expert gun handler now and does hand to hand combat well, but man was it getting old fast.Bill Skarsgard, as the villain, seems to be tapping into Rami Malek from \"No Time To Die\" He's a meglamaniac whose ties to this under ground assassin league is anchored to funding it. Did they ever explain why this society even exists? Probably not. I was bored. Also, Ian MacShane's Manager role is exhaustively pedestrian.. I mean, tiresome tropes come out of his mouth as if it were the first time hearing it.Everyone is desperate to be cool in this flick. Finally, the Donnie Yen character. Okay, a LOT cannot be forgiven. He is dragged into wanting to kill Wick because of threats to his family. Yet, he kills everyone BUT Wick and yet gets to survive. Here's the problem. It telegraphed it when he would incapacitate the guys in the kitchen of the Osaka branch. Instead of violently kill them. That's how you can tell he wasn't going to be a bad dude.Oof. They add an extra assassin who totes along a dog. That dog was getting on my nerves. And I love dogs. This dog seemed to be trained to sick men's privates. For some reason. After the 5th go at this gag, it was dead in the water.This is a subpar entry into the series. Though they kill off Wick in this flick (yeah right) he see some future installment with say...the daughter of the Osaka branch who seemed to have projected a future conflict with Wick in the future.This series will never end as long as simple minded audiences exists. All Sound And Fury Adds Up To Nothing."},{"users":"MisterJxroen","ratings":"8","titles":"Mr. Wick Around The World","reviews":"I was fortunate enough to view 'John Wick: Chapter 4' in a double-bill (Chapter 3 prior to 4) avant-premiere screening at the theater with my family. I've always been a great admirer of the practical action sequences portrayed in the 'John Wick' films.Undoubtedly, 'John Wick Chapter 1' remains my favorite, followed closely by Chapter 3. It definitely has something to do with the fact that the type of action and gun-fu felt so new back then. That is also the one main thing this fourth film suffers from in my opinion: innovativeness. Though this issue only really exists throughout the first half of the film.The Paris sequences & pretty much all action sequences featuring Donnie Yen (as 'Caine') serve as a breathe of fresh air in this film. Some new weapons and technology such as the bow & arrow, the nunchucks and some fancy incendiary bullets make certain action scenes a joy to watch. Though the other sequences are certainly cool, I can't help but feel like I've seen it quite a few times already.The cinematography was definitely at it's highest point in this fourth film. The movie was absolutely gorgeous. The colors are vibrant and ultramodern, almost in a science fiction-y way. The way action sequences are shot have always been amazing; from long takes to overhead shots, back to running between cars on the Champs-Elysees and dueling like it's the wild west. It's a lot of bloody fun! I'm slightly saddened by the fact so much action was shot in dark and distractingly lit environments, but overall the practicality of it all was still there.I enjoyed the music more in the prior movies, though I haven't separately listened to the OST yet so I know what to do. Sound design, costumes and world building is another massive win for me. I love this world they've managed to create full of assassins and strange people. It was nice to explore so many different countries and 'continentals'. It really helped with making this film different from the others.Keanu Reeves is always a joy to watch, what else can I say? I'm also very happy they brought in legends like Clancy Brown, Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada. Their skills and overall badass vibes just fit so fell in this world. Speaking of legends, I'm saddened by the recent passing of Lance Reddick, who portrayed 'Charon' the concierge. I'm glad to have seen him one last time in this role and I pay my respects.Overall I rate this film a 8\/10, on par for me with chapter 2. If you come to see John Wick absolutely kicking people's ass while also breaking his own back numerous times (you'd think), this is the right film for you. You don't really get a lot of opportunities to breathe, and I love it."},{"users":"tarikibric","ratings":"8","titles":"Incredible piece of Film.","reviews":"So i watched the movie in IMAX.

Good acting, and after all this seriousness, there are some funny moments as well that got a chuckle out of me.

I agree with my fellow reviewers that this is definitely one of the greatest action movies ever made - as were they all. It is clear that the Director and Production Team really put a lot of effort into pushing the boundaries of action, and the location of Paris was used to maximum effect to produce some stunning action sequences.

The screenplay was so pretentious and pointless, the dialog looked forced and boring, katana swords vs. Bullets, and almost every bullet could be fenced off by the katana sword blades. The scenarios and the plots just kept stacked up without any reason or clue, just kill, kill, kill...nothing but kills. All the fighting sequences just like Shaw Brothers' 1970s poor and laughable Hong Kong martial art movies, heavily choreographically staged, looked so forced and fake. Every kill was not killed with one bullets but many, yet the handguns seemed equipped with endless bullets, bang, bang, bang, even the fallen guys already dead, but still needed to be shot several times more to increase the violent sound effect. I don't know what's the purpose of making these 4th Chapter, and I think the 1st Chapter only needed a following 2nd Chapter to end it, but what the heck, brainless young viewers need bloody fights, more dead bodies, ridiculous screenplay with clueless storyline, no real plots or real story really needed, just created something like violent video games.When John Wick fought for his life in the Japanese hotel against so many clueless foes and the Zatoishi-like blind swordsman played by Donny Yen with a Botox injected face, we all decided to quit at the same time.Hey, it's time to wrap it up, guys, no sense to continue to Chapter 5: You've Been Conned, AGAIN!"},{"users":"persister-71174","ratings":"3","titles":"The first three were good","reviews":"I was greatly disappointed with #4. The story line was weak. If all you care about is mindless fighting and shooting, you will be happy. I know that is the key element in this story, but people still need a good story, and some actual acting. As it was released, it is already quite long. So, I feel that they could have eliminated much of the ridiculous fighting in the traffic circle of Paris and added more meat to the story. Too much of the movie was incomplete. There could have been more for Lawrence Fishburne. And they could have done more with Shamier Anderson. I understand that they wanted to close out the series with John Wick's name restored. So, they could have done more, in the latter half of the movie, with his efforts to restore his name. This movie just didn't come together for me.

It was mostly grunts and a couple of classic Keanu lines like \"I have to get back,\" monotone half sentences. But I suppose that is part of his charm. The point is the dialogue was terrible.I understand it's not an emotional drama so dialogue and plot are not at the top of the list, but could we not have gotten some decent story telling?

Fight scenes are great but they were way too long and so unrealistic. Not nearly as good as the other 3 movies. If they would have given us a little more background on some of the new characters it would have made more sense and given them more depth. In previous movies John would use his Krav Magra skills to take down or slow down someone then a double tap to the head would usually be sufficient. Those fight scenes were outstanding and believable. Almost all of fights in this movie ridiculous. People were shot and stabbed several times and looked like they weren't hurt. How many times did John get hit by a car and just walked away? How many times do you have to hit someone in the face with nunchucks before they go down. I used to think John was special.

The main reason is that for this one being the longest of them all, the plot had more holes and the random new characters lacked the background they needed.Throwing in Mr. Nobody was just dumb, as was his story. It was just too random and lazy, especially with all that extra runtime. Having all the opportunities to collect the bounty was just too easy and took away from all other more deserving assassins to collect, and more importantly, his reasons for not cashing in were just too ridiculous. Instead of introducing him as a new character, they should've capitalized more on Fishburne's character and involved him more in this film, instead of him being a delivery boy, that was just a huge let-down.And as much as I love all the action scenes, and they were the best and longest thus far, they just didn't feel as authentic as the action in all the precious films.

The opposite cannot be said, though.Even if you turn off your brain and watch, most of it does not make sense, at all.However, if you are into mindless, illogical action scenes, John Wick is the film for you.One more thing, in a gun fight, if you lose to a guy who cannot see, in brightly lit environments, maybe you should give up your career as an assassin.

The sheer number and intensity of \"kills\" will truly elude you.JW4 rather nicely returns for a riot of startling violence tempered by a melange of perfectly cerebral philosophical moments. Unlike the sardonic \"ultra violence\" of Stanley Kubrick's, A Clockwork Orange (1971), JW4 is sensibly raw, with just enough creepy humor to keep you from completely jumping out of your own skin.It doesn't hurt that JW4 has a great cast. Reeves immediately sells Wick & company's dark commitment with a raw emotion somewhat reminiscent of a Clint Eastwood Western. The massive emotional exhaustion which unfolds simply adds more gravity to this newest Chapter. \"Sauce for the goose,\" one might say.Flaws? Very few. And JW fans won't care.

You also have to believe that this franchise was strong enough to merit at least 3 sequels. Jury still out there. And, most important, you have to believe that the key to making a good film from an essentially weak and over-done premise is to extend it to 3 grueling hours, and throw lots of money at it. Donnie Yen steals every scene he is in, and makes you wonder if his semi-retirement from Asian films was really a good idea?

Forget how awesome and practical gun-fu was in the first film, this time everyone has magical bullet proof clothing that just makes the fights longer and the whole choreography less believable.There are a couple of great cinematic and tense scenes (I specifically loved the sword fight NOT involving Wick and the scene where the camera is on the ceiling inside the abandoned building). Sadly there's a ton of things I hated: the almos 3 hour duration, the whole retcon and rush to stablish a new villain, the weak motivations gor said villain, the blind guy with superpowers, the needless \"tracker\" guy and his dog, the amount of random and long fighting scenes that just kept going and kept happening...

Watched this in the cinema last night and its the worse movie I've seen in the cinema for a long time. I have never been so bored. No apparent storyline, repetitive, noisy, scene after scene of people fighting each other and shooting people from 2 inches away and wooden acting by Keanu Reeves. I was bored after 30 minutes and couldn't wait for it to finish. The only good thing about the movie was the dog that was in it. 3hrs of my life I will never get back. If anyone is considering going to watch this in the cinema I wouldnt bother wasting your evening."},{"users":"theffachrif","ratings":"10","titles":"It has been an honor, Mr. Wick","reviews":"Directed by Chad Stahelski, John Wick Chapter 4 continues the struggle of John Wick (Keanu Reeves) with the price on his head ever increasing, he finally uncovers a way to get free of The High Table for good. But he must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe.Since this franchise started in 2014 with the release of its first movie, I'm in awe of how this franchise has come. I had no clue what they gonna bring in the final chapter since the last three movies always set the bar higher for the next, especially the action sequences. And somehow they still did it and I think it's a perfect culmination and the best movie probably not just in the franchise but also in modern action movies ever. The amount of story and action is quite perfectly balanced, it's kinda an improvement from Chapter 3 which I think is just endless action from the beginning. They also introduced a lot of exciting and interesting new characters each with enough backstory to understand their relationship with each other and their connection to the story.Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, and Scott Adkins are simply phenomenal. Scott Adkins is almost unrecognizable in prosthetics and a fat body suit and we definitely need to see more of Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd playing this type of role, he nailed it. The technical aspects are jaw-dropping, spanning from camerawork, stunning visuals and colors, and gorgeous cinematography to production and sound design. Some movies, especially action flicks definitely have one if not more memorable sequences, well John Wick: Chapter 4 is packed with over-the-top and memorable action sequences, the stunt choreography is truly flawless.Salute to director Chad Stahelski for delivering the John Wick movies that were distinct from the others and closing them perfectly, he really saved the best for the last one (or there might be more). I'm excited to see where this franchise is gonna be taken next.Don't let the length fool you, you won't feel it as soon as you hop in for an exhilarating ride."},{"users":"ivanjuarez-32826","ratings":"10","titles":"Greatest Action Movie of the Decade!!!","reviews":"This is honestly the best John Wick film since Chapter 2. My grandpa and I saw it last Friday and yo, it was a blast for both of us because both are love with these action movies. You can try understand John Wick: Chapter 4 is somewhat different such as Caine, the deuteragonist, he's send to kill John which is antagonistic and deadly; but you latter come sympathize with him due to his goal to save his daughter from execution.I personally respect him for giving Shimazu Koji a honorable death in battle, although Koji's daughter Akira wants revenge for that. Meanwhile with all the bounties and man-hunts, I'll say it's practically all Santino's fault for forfeiting John's life due to his desire to join the High Table and over run New York with the Camorra."},{"users":"marwinsingh-30063","ratings":"10","titles":"A big thanks to Keanu Reeves and entire crew for giving us best action movie ever made in Hollywood...","reviews":"There is no denying that John wick series will become an classical masterpiece in future.. If you've seen previous 3 films you then you should know what to expect.. Keanu Reeves is back again legendery hitman aka Baba Yaga who'll stop at nothing to earn his freedom and defeat high table and seeing him doing that will give you an unforgettable cinematic experience.. For 3 hrs I was lost in this epic world that director Chad Stahlski has created for this story, Keanu Reeves is already an action icon, rest of cast has also done a perfect job.. Action choreographer and stunt team deserves an Oscar for their effort which lead us to some of the best fight scenes and action sequences ever played on big screen.. Cinematography is also very beautiful, dark and neon filled visulas just enhance the experience of story there is also some drama and emotional moments in this story but main aspect of this film is out of the world action.. There is a unique over the head camera action scene which is best part of this movie, Donnie yen is also great here proving again that he is one of the best action stars of Asian cinema, Scott Adkins is also done a surprisingly great scene which I was not expecting because he usually play hardcore fighter in his movies here he is hilarious and his look is different.. From start to finish JW 4 is an action ride which gets better and better each passing minute, 3rd act will keep you edge of your seat, last 45 to 50 minutes were some of the best action sequences I've ever seen in my life and I've seen thousands of films from every genere from all over the world cinema industries so i know a good action scene when I see it and believe me this was something I've seen first time in my life.... Overall don't miss this film if you're fan of action movies and if you're an Baba Yaga fan like me then just go for it to experience it on big screen with Dolby atmos sound you'll spend a quality time....AN MODERN ACTION MASTERPIECE.. 10\/10 .."},{"users":"mechmandeep","ratings":"6","titles":"A little over the top and stale","reviews":"My expectations were high specially around the fight sequence but it was disappointing. Last three chapters had some special sachets l set ups and sequences, the stable fight scene and the knife fight in the antique store. That was the genius of the movie, even though you expect it to be a kill fest there was creativity around that preventing it from being repetitive.Chapter 4 is just that, pretty much the overdose of the boring sequences from the first 3 chapters.The other aspect around how much hits and badgering can John take is also puts this in superhero genre. I mean, he is not captain america for crying out loud.The storyline holds well though there are crucial pieces missing. How did he find the elder and was it just to get back the ring? With almost 3 hours duration you expect to cover that. There are lose ends with a daughter's revenge for her father and John wick letting his friend die in vein.I feel they could've cut one fight scene to cover these points and competed the movie.

The film, which runs at two a half hours, is relentless. 90% of this film is action, it barely gives you any time to breathe before moving on to the next fight.And the action sequences themselves, are with out a doubt the best I've ever seen. Spanning multiple locations, we have insane gun fights, swordplay, hand to hand, car chases; even archery and as we've come to expect from Chapter 3, some dog killing sequences.The story is actually pretty solid, with the only negative of the movie being the cheesey one liners from every character; but actually, I don't even mind - we know this is supposed to be fun and not take itself too seriously, and whilst Keanu himself in my opinion delivers his lines with incredible averageness, it almost adds to the movie. The sets themselves are also gorgeous, taking us from Japan to France, and not once are you disappointed with the scenery.If you're a fan of action sequences, strap yourself in for the most incredible experience you'll ever have."},{"users":"kosmasp","ratings":"9","titles":"Once more with a feeling","reviews":"No pun intended - and that feeling can be many things. While I still see Keanu from the Bill and Ted franchise .. the way he talks and how he \"acts\" ... well if you've seen it once, you can't unsee it. That said, it does not take away anything from the action extravaganza that is going on in this. Actually that makes me want to revisit the other Wick movies and maybe re-rate them. Giving them a higher score.Also I have to admit, that even though Denzel is the better actor (no secret here), franchise wise Wick has totally obliterated the Equalizer franchise ... kind of like he obliterates his enemies as Wick. You may wonder why they even try .. I guess for our amusement. For those who are able to stomache all the violence that is of course.I did watch this on an Imax screen and let me tell you: violence never looked better. But also everything else. Be it dawn, sunrise and everything in between. There are many scenes and there are some quotes that should be inspirational too. Friendship means little when it's convenient ... that is some deep ... stuff right there.I don't think that the movie gives the viewer too many riddles when it comes to guessing where it all leads to. You also should not mind the fact that Keanu or rather Wick must have a bionic body ... or his suit actually is made of a material that shields his body ... well one or the other ... or you just suspend your disbelief and go with the flow. It makes as much sense as driving cars into space (yes looking at you Fast and Furious franchise) ... but we do not watch these movies for logic and rhyme and reason. I'd hope the same applies to you.There are some really great visual stunts in Paris - and it looks like they shot them there. But CGI is so far ahead ... who really knows? It does look awesome though. And towards the end ... the action inside a house and the way it is shot ... the director is coming up with new stuff all the time.And for the first time ever (in a John Wick movie), there is an after credit scene ... so sit down and wait for it - even if it may not be entirely satisfactory ... then again, until the next one comes out (it surely must be announced soon, no matter how this ended), the ending here is also ... well you may not be entirely happy with it ... but happy is a word that is missing in Wicks dictionary anyway ... so there we go.Edit: I don't do pointers when I write reviews which leads to me forgetting stuff. Lance Reddick who recently passed away and will be missed, was obviously an integral part of the franchise. Many may know him from TV shows, such as Fringe, The Wire and many more. But apart from him and many recurring characters (those who survive that is), we get many Newcomers. Bill Skarsgard being the top villain - and he does a great accent! As does Scott Adkins - ja! And of course the excellent as always Donnie Yen! The action (choreography) is the star - but it doesn't hurt to have some great people in front of the camera too."},{"users":"squigemartin","ratings":"10","titles":"DAMN.

I'll start positive. Keanu is kind of cool so that helped a lot. Now to some criticism. As others have mentioned, most of the fight scenes were choreographed so embarrassingly bad that I spent most of the film watching bad guys standing off to the side and waiting for their turn for John Wick to kill them. We see literally hundreds of trained assassins pointing and shooting high powered automatic weapons John at (who is usually standing out in the open) and yet non ever strike John. John falls flat on his face from the top of a building, gets hit 5 times by speeding cars,rolls down 6 flights of stairs after being pummeled relentlessly and in every case gets up almost none worse for wear. Even his suit never got dirty. At some points I accidentally laughed out loud.A huge, huge plot hole was the radio announcer stating John's every move and update (including the increasing bounty money for killing John Wick). There was never any indication how they received the information instantaneously or why all the assassins happened to be listening to the radio at the same time. Who listens to radio now anyway?The ending!?! Did he die? Did I miss it? One minute he's shot but still walking, talking needing a little rest and bath. The next scene shows his tombstone.

The action is off the charts, the stunts are better than ever, and just when you think there is nothing new to see in a fight-or car chase-Baba Yaga will surprise and shock you. Keanu returns for maybe his last ride as John Wick, at least according to how this one wraps things up-but, I'm sure Keanu still has another one or two left in the tank. Bill plays the Marquis, a sort of big shot in the High Table organization that wants Keanu dead. Donnie plays an old friend of Keanu's that Bill forces to hunt Keanu. Shamier is another hired gun that Bill gets to join in on the hunt. Shamier is called the Tracker and has a highly trained dog that tag teams Shamier in fights-on voice commands. All Keanu wants is to get his freedom back and his name cleared. He learns of a loop hole in the High Table rules and focuses all his abilities on reaching that agenda. One of the fight sequences on a flight of stairs is very entertaining and the car chase in Paris is unbelievable-kudos to the stunt people. Make sure you don't leave the theater too soon because there is a scene after the end credits that involves a characters' fate and there is a dedication after that to Lance Reddick-he died March 17 2023-who played the hotel concierge, Charon.It's rated R for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 49 minutes.I loved this movie and would buy it on Blu_Ray."},{"users":"ThironthoramDude","ratings":"9","titles":"Fun kick ass John Wick Chapter","reviews":"Although this latest installment was a tad bit longer than the rest of these movies in the series it was every bit worth it.

A couple of them really stand out. One overhead shot of John Wick running from room to room fighting his enemies And the other with John Wick, Donny Chen and group fighting in a room filled with art pieces made of bulletproof glass.The climax was one to behold as well.On the whole it was a fun John Wick experience with a lot of entertaining fight sequences that makes it worth your money and time.

I found it really bland and boring.The main issue was that the stunts felt like they pulled a lot of punches. Almost every action sequence felt numb, like they didn't have any weight or any stakes. Fight scenes would go for far too long and yet leave absolutely no impact. Someone could fall off of a building, shake it off and be totally fine again. There were acrobatics, sure, but it felt like Power Rangers combat.It also felt like this installment was being crushed under the weight of its own lore. The hints of greater lore and underlying history in the other movies were great, and part of what got me really interested in the continuing franchise. By the fourth installment this has become so all encompassing that it absorbs the whole movie in a convoluted plot of pomp and politics."},{"users":"Bosch","ratings":"6","titles":"Same Tedious Repetition and CGI Blood","reviews":"Clocking in at a bladder-busting three hours, this fourth Johnny Wick movie from Lionsgate stubbornly sticks to the franchise's formula. The vague plot sees John Wick still on the run from the High Table, who have not only raised his bounty to $20 million, but also deconsecrates and destroys any Continental Hotel linked to John's movements. Cue a number of repetative action setpieces (all happening at night) that are separated by static dialogue scenes in which characters spout non-stop aphorisms, the first one being no less than Ned Kelly's \"Such is life.\"Delayed two years by the novel coronavirus pandemic, JOHN WICK 4 has Hong Kong martial arts cinema legend Donnie Yen co-starring as Zatoichi-style blind swordsman Caine, an old friend of Wick's. The supporting cast is filled out by Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, Ian McShane, Clancy Brown, Laurence Fishburne, and Shamier Anderson among others. Major disappointments are Keanu Reeve's worst ever line readings, and the wimpy melee fight scenes: punch, kick, chop, stab, pointblank CGI headshot, repeat. But such fare saw JOHN WICK 3 earn $328 million from a budget of $75 million, so loyal fans should enjoy it. I reckon it's good for one viewing because of the ending.

That said, eye candy is almost all this experience offers. Most everyone involved in this film seemed like they were sleepwalking when the action stopped. It doesn't matter - everything in this picture is done for style points. There's barely any story here at all, and what story exists is so thin that it could be told in about 2 minutes of this 169 minute film. The remaining attempt to tell a story is so full of holes supported by bad acting and bloated style that it would have been a much better film just to leave it all out and just show a montage of fight sequences.The Marquis character never shows the ability to do anything except sneer in an outrageous French accent and surround himself with dumb lieutenants. The Bowery King and the Harbinger characters are trotted out at the beginning and the end of the story just to to provide some atmosphere.Rina Sawayama's acting ability is confined to contorting her face in into pithy expressions in response to her character's father's philosophical meanderings.Even though small arms fire fills the air and bodies pile up on the road, cars continue to drive around the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es as if nothing is happening.The same thing happens during the disco scene, where perfect 20-something bodies continue to obliviously dance away while axe killings splatter blood all around them.The DJ drops the needle on a record to start a song (bad sign for a DJ), while the old reel-to-real tape keeps spinning...just because they look better spinning I guess.This isn't really a movie; it's more like a moving painting.

And less.","reviews":"Just watched John Wick: Chapter 4 online, by finding a free site that pirated the film. Yeah, it had French subtitles and was interrupted a few times with ads for a lottery in India. But I was able to speed up the dull parts, slow down and replay the action scenes. The only thing I couldn't see was a special scene after the credits, as this version ended just before the credits began.If you saw the previous three chapters, you can appreciate that they upped the choreographic level of the fight scenes; the death total easily pushes into the hundreds. Some of it seems gratuitous (OK, it's almost all gratuitous) but it sets a cinematic bar for this kind of lethal action that will likely never be matched.Some of the locations (Osaka, Berlin, Paris) seem to have been picked solely for their aesthetics, as in the previous film that took the action out of New York. How this guy gets to instantly zip around the world without being noticed (except by one or two trackers who seem to get to where he winds up even before he does) is almost as mystifying as how he manages to fall multiple times from several stories up, or get hit by cars multiple times, or tumble down dozens of Parisian steps leading to Sacre Couer de Montmartre Church more than once (why did I suddenly think of Laurel & Hardy's classic \"The Music Box\" -- the one with the piano repeatedly going up and down the long stairs -- while watching this?) and nobody seems smart enough to fire at him from a safe distance while behind a safe barrier. Simple rule... if you get within ten feet of Wick, you are dead. Hey, remember that he can kill with a pencil? Here he attacks a guy with a playing card! Oh, and he gets to use nunchucks for the first time. Lots of bodies breaking through glass, but going through it never seems to cause any cuts.It is still implausible that so many supposed professional hit men are so easily dispatched and seem unable to get even one good head shot in out of the hundreds of tries.I won't give away the assumed ending, which is both logical and anti-climactic, yet since I didn't see the post-credits scene, I have to wonder if it's a ruse to allow for more of the franchise, seeing as how each film makes more money than the one before it. With this film, the longest of the four, being nearly three hours long, I can only imagine that any fifth film will require bladders of titanium and include a body count in the thousands.Reeves has even fewer lines here than in any of the previous shorter films, mostly just saying \"Yeah\" a lot. He and most of the others talk in epigrams and fortune-cookie-style one-liners meant to sound deep, but usually just come across as goofy or puzzling.The tracker known as Mr. Nobody has a dog trained to attack on command, similar (almost identical) to Halle Berry's dogs in Chapter 3. When he says \"Nuts\" the dog goes for, well, you can guess where. At least five times. When Wick prevents the dog from getting shot (we know how important dogs are to the franchise) Mr. Nobody rethinks his entire raison. Seems his dog's life was worth more than 40 million dollars. But then, killing a pup is the original sin that started this entire franchise!Some parts are better than the whole. Some parts make little or no sense. Not a single cop is ever seen no matter how much violence ensues; indeed, in several places, while guns are blazing and swords are swinging, the civilians just act as if nothing is happening, and make no attempt to flee. So much is a cross between cartoonish -- several Wiley-Coyote-style falls, minus the anvil, but still no apparent injuries -- and video game choreography (there's even a god's-eye-view tracking shot that clearly was lifted from an actual video game).I'm told that the classic 1979 New York action film \"The Warriors\" was the template for this film, with Wick substituting for an entire NYC gang trying to make it home. In an outright theft, they even have a black female DJ's closeup mouth to the mic smugly following Wick's trip across the city, exactly as in the earlier film (Lynne Thigpen did it better; oh, those lips!).If you've seen the previous three films, and appreciate what was done superlatively, and overlooked the implausibles and recycled tropes, I guess you will have to see Chapter 4 for whatever supposed closure it may or may not offer. When someone catches the post-credits scene, please let me know what was in it, as I'm pretty sure it's the key to how Chapter 5 begins.Yeah... a franchise film that debuts at $72 million (almost double the last bounty on Wick's life), the best start of the whole series, isn't going to toss away the opportunity to rake in even more. After all, the High Table hasn't been defeated, the New York Continental has to be rebuilt, and Laurence Fishburne needs more scenery to chew up. Expect gratuitous trips to London, Rome, and Istanbul."},{"users":"ecsecs-91225","ratings":"3","titles":"It all goes to downhill...","reviews":"Starts out great then crash n burns halfway through. True to form and early on we have great cinematography, tense stare downs, witty dialog, diverse fighting styles well choreographed. Attention to detail, like having to re-load or dealing with injuries (case in point, if your hand gets cut in half you ain't pulling a trigger or getting in a fist fight any time soon). The travel of John Wick going from point A to point B should always be an action packed unpredictable blood bath. All changed as this movie progressed. One can only assume ill-timed social distancing requirements and lazy production habits currently plaguing Hollywood started taking hold. Mr Wick, who typically has to fight through anonymous bounty hunters mixed in with crowds, no longer a problem. Plus Wick is showing up everywhere, Tokyo to NY to Berlin to Paris with zero explanation of how he got there. In prior installments arrangement to go to NY cost him a finger and he got branded just to secure passage to Casablanca. Fight scenes and gun battles, all loosing their timing and explosive choreography...halfway through replaced with tricky camera angles and flash lighting to hide the shoddiness. They establish a blind assassin using sensors to track enemy movement in close quarters (very cleaver), but all of a sudden he can bullseye gunshots at distance unassisted? The car chase scene through Paris, looked like it was shot on an original iPhone. Most obvious, running out of bullets stopped being a problem. Why? One of the cool things about John Wicks previous gun battles were the slick way he acquired ammo and reloaded. Eliminating that aspect was just plain lazy. All that aside I'm forced to agree with many, the gun battle with the exploding shotgun shells with a top down ceiling view, ingenious! Admittedly it was done so well it's how this movie got three stars instead of one.Still we have a contradictory plot enhanced by flip flopping character motivations. Comparing what came before, in every action sequence you always knew who was for or against Wick. His allies, enemies, old friends, fanatical fans, were unwavering no matter how how they felt personally. As this movie progressed you didn't know from one punch or gun shot to the next who was going to be on who's side.Note to the producers, if you're going to place Wick in the most crowded cities on earth you have to have swarms of people around, not just 2 or 3 like you're watching a staged play. You'll never see just two people on Tokyo subway train or walking through central park. It does nothing but take you right out of the movie."},{"users":"sawoodward-93770","ratings":"10","titles":"Absolutely WICKed","reviews":"Well I may have just watched one of the greatest action movies ever made.

Keanu Reeves gives an incredible performance as John Wick as always. From the opening scene the film grabs your attention and doesn't let it go. Every fight scene (and there is a lot of them) takes place in the most gorgeous places with stunning almost otherworldly lighting. The cinematography is insanely good and a treat for the eyes. Choosing the action set pieces to take place in Osaka to Berlin to Paris gives the feeling that you as the spectator are being taken on a journey, thereby justifying the almost 3 hour run time. Donnie Yen's character; Cain and The Tracker are instant fan favourites and I'm looking forward to seeing more of them in the future. A fantastic film with a satisfying ending that leaves nothing to be desired. Well done to everyone involved. 10\/10."},{"users":"chand-suhas","ratings":"7","titles":"Painting the town red, Baba Yaga style.","reviews":"John Wick Chapter 4 is lengthy. By lengthy I mean it has an action packed first act followed a slower second act sans much action but makes up for it with the craziest final act where all hell breaks loose. John Wick after surviving the fall in the previous film, gets back to business of killing his way to freedom. The table has found a new head who pits John's friend against him. As the brutal fight resume, John is suggested a clever way out of this mess and how he pulls it off being an ex-communicado forms the story.Donnie Yen's addition to the franchise takes the fourth film a notch higher, raising the bar for the stunts. The first act is indeed action packed and it flies by quicker than the bullets fired. The second act gets the story forward without much action until Scott Adkins shows up, which makes for a stylish action block with enough humor. The highlight is however the final act in Paris. The insane action sequence leading to the final fight gave me my money's worth and also covers up the generic weak villain which Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd tries to make merry off.It is indeed a fitting entry to the franchise and the first John Wick film to have an end credit scene, one has to sit through the end credits completely for that scene."},{"users":"jacksongaming-80094","ratings":"10","titles":"A thrill ride of a lifetime","reviews":"John Wick Chapter 4 is a love letter to action film-making and every action cinema lovers wet dream. The cinematography is oscar worthy, the neo-noir genre has never looked better on the big screen as the bold and vibrant colours makes each scene of this film a bold underlined statement that what you are experiencing is something special.The action choreography utilizies 100% of each and every set design used in the film to incorporate drama, thrill and also comedy. This movie has everything you could ever ask for - guns, knifes, nunchucks, katanas, martial arts, cars, flamethrowers, bare hands etc. The stuntwork is jaw-dropping and adrenaline inducing, specially a stunt that was performed on a staircase on the later half of the film, left me wondering how did the stunt coordinator get that Tom Cruise-level life threatening stunt greenlit.But what truly makes this story special are the characters and the drama surrounding them as they manoeuvre their way through this twisted world of crime where each person is their only friend. There are a lot of new characters introduced and none of them feel throwaway as each and everyone of them bring something new and exciting to the table and moves the narrative forward. And the centre of this narrative, Keanu Reeves who plays John Wick, a loving husband proves once again why his contribution to this role will be remembered forever as something that revolutionalized action film-making.This was the one of the most satisfying experience I ever had inside a movie theatre and it leaves you with the question that how many times are you going to return to experience this once in a lifetime masterclass in action film-making.10\/10 - John wick Chapter 4 is a a modern day classic."},{"users":"johnnyhbtvs27","ratings":"9","titles":"Up There With The Best Movie Franchises","reviews":"John Wick: Chapter 4 is another great entry in this wonderful series.

A totally phoned in money grab.","reviews":"My son and I love the John Wick movies but both agreed this was really bad. There were a few creative aspects to the fight scenes, cinematography and effects, but in terms of the writing the whole movie was just one long incessant fight scene repeated what felt like hundreds of times without any story to break it up or make any of it matter at all to the viewer. In action movies it's obviously about the action and not much is needed to make the story 'matter' but my goodness at least have the basics of an actual story that makes the action compelling in some basic way. There were a number of excellent actors in this movie but sadly the writing made it so that even they couldn't contribute anything to the story. Went in excited but I seriously wanted to walk out about half way through when I realized it was just going to be non-stop fight scenes and nothing else for 3 whole hours. It was truly mind-numbing."},{"users":"kjproulx","ratings":"9","titles":"One of the Best Straight-Up Action Films in Years","reviews":"I didn't expect much when John Wick hit theatres in 2014. I was shocked at how much fun I had with that film though and have enjoyed Chapters two and three almost just as much. The action has always been the reason to see these films and Keanu Reeves just being Keanu Reeves? C'mon, it doesn't get much more enjoyable than that. Well, John Wick: Chapter 4 has just hit theatres and it's not just my favourite John Wick film, it's one of my favourite straight-up mainstream action films in years. Here's why, especially if you've enjoyed the previous three, this one is a must-see.Picking up relatively soon after the events of John Wick: Chapter 3, we see John Wick has pretty much recovered after an impossible feat at the end of that third film. He learns how to get to the High Table and also how he can be freed of being a wanted and hunted man, but new foes and many new armies will stop at nothing to take him down before he accomplishes that task. That's pretty much it for the plot, even though much more happens throughout the film that I will not spoil here. Without wasting any time though, I have to say that this film pulls no punches in its action or story for that matter. This is easily the most intricate story and the greatest action this franchise has given us yet.At a run time that closes in on three hours, I never felt it. Every 20-30 minutes this film dives into action sequences that last a good 20 minutes each. On top of that, I have to commend the cinematography by Dan Laustsen, because this is some of the best-filmed action scenes I've seen in years. Yes, there are times when it starts to feel excessive, but that's usually right about the time that those sequences are concluding. The action never felt like it overstayed its welcome this time around. The action feels like a lot, but it also feels more sparse due to the long run time.In the end, John Wick: Chapter 4 does a great job furthering this story, expanding on the mythology, and giving us somewhat of a conclusion to this franchise. I'm not sure where a fifth film could go from here. I've enjoyed the overdone performance by Keanu Reeves throughout the entire franchise and that is only accentuated here. Yes, as most of these films go, I've had issues with the screenplay in terms of the simplistic dialogue, but I honestly feel that it's just intentional at this point and therefore it made me enjoy this one even more. If a silly, well-crafted action flick can be a near-masterpiece, I'll say this comes close, but with a few minor issues. I loved watching this film."},{"users":"timteo","ratings":"4","titles":"Bewickered","reviews":"Yes, I tried to make a pun out of the word \"Bewildered\" because this film seems like it tried to do just that- make a pun out of the actual John wick films. The first was undoubtedly the best- it was simple, realistic, unintentionally humourous and had a very clear goal. Then, it became a little over the top in the third, especially when he visited the elder and wanted to remain alive just so he \"could remember her\".Huh.Anyway, I had high expectations walking into the fourth instalment because I do love this franchise. However, it was far too much. The action sequences were shot well and choreographed fantastically but it was unrealistic even for a made believe world. Unless that was what they were going for? More of a Marvelesque\/graphic 300 and Sin City- Zac Snyder type vibe? It was no doubt beautiful in terms of Sets, costumes and cinematography and ok, really do have to hand it to the stunt and action choreography team.. if there was an Oscar's category for stunts and fights, they will take it.Unfortunately, no amount of ornaments are going to save a movie with a lack of story. The acting here and dialogue delivery is pretty weak... I was also confused with the motivation. I understand Winston and John's friendship but then again, why is he so hell bent on surviving? John hates the trade, he's out then he's in, then he's in with such a goal to survive but for what reason? So then he's back in and wanting to die ...with honour? It seems out of character to want to get people he cares about involved and die for him and he doesn't even know why he wants to live so bad and run from the high table ... then later, he's in the game again to take revenge for his Japanese friend but then doesn't end up avenging him in the end, the guys daughter had to do it herself. Look, I want to say something prolific and sound like a great movie critic but I'm not. So I'm going to just jump in here into the sea of 9s and perfect 10 reviews and hope I can land like John wick after rolling down 20 flights of stairs and not die.I actually went into micro sleep at the 2hr mark because it was too much action. I know, it's crazy. But I woke up because an old couple had to pass me as they were walking out. They shook their heads, I think they were ready for some quiet tea and snacks.Hey, you know what peeves me, is that john travels from Osaka to new York then to some other paris and no one kills him on the plane or even the airport? In air, there's no where to go, they would defo be able to kill him in the airplane toilet of even disguise as a hot flight attendant and spike his drink. Also, the blind guy is better than so many other assassins... also, they used the same freaking dog antics as Halle berry but with a black guy that's randomly introduced for fan service or something. Also, i totally saw it coming at the end, as if John will kill Donnie yen. But then they went back to the black guy while he's sitting there drinking beer with his dog and he's like \"that was good\/smart\" and I'm like \"whut, no it's nhat\".And like if you love your dog, you wouldn't be feeding it beer.. hello?Then also, John fell from buildings and got shot up and is almost immortal. But at the end he just dies from a gunshot wound in his liver with no will to live. He says \"Winston, take me home\", then Winston is like \"yea ok\". But he doesn't even run after him, he just lets John walk down the steps and he dies. But like now he has no will to live? I thought his goal was to live to remember her. If anything, this should've happened in John wick 2, where he gives in after avenging his puppy and getting his car back, then should lie in the sunset to die and reunite with Helen.Argh but nope he \"dies\". But then the Lionsgate production team realised what a hit this installment was and decides to do a number 5 and 6. So I guess John faked his death and then now comes out of hiding wants to avenge Donnie Yen or the Samurai dude, then they introduce jet li or Jackie Chan and omg it's going to be real Expendables type thing, brainless popcorn flick where everyone just fights real good fight scenes with explosions and falls, fire, snow ice and stuff, lots of injuries, cuts, bloods, 10000 stunt extra deaths, but the main guys limp but still fight with 100% blows and no one dies. Then the ending finally the bad guy has a real dramatic death with flowers and slow music and then John wick is like struggling but saves the day and says \"yeah\".Ok rant over. Oh well, guess i will watch John wick 5 anyway just to see how bad it is. Lol."},{"users":"Paragon240","ratings":"9","titles":"John Wick: Chapter 4 is at the peak of action cinema and fight choreography. What the film lacks in story is dramatically overcome with the most stunning action ever seen.","reviews":"John Wick: Chapter 4 is an overwhelming feast of action brilliance! For the entire 2.5-hour runtime, this movie transitions from weapon to weapon, set piece to set piece, and spectacle to spectacle topping anything ever seen. The fight sequences never stop, and their beauty and intricacies drop jaw while breaking jaw. From the scene with the nunchucks to swords to shotguns to hatchets to hand-to-hand - among the greatest, if not the pinnacle, of action choreography. The cinematography creatively showcases each scene and battle, painting the action in bright colors and finding clever angles to keep the action fresh and engaging. As always, Reeves is incredible in the role, but the supporting cast of martial artists helps make this film what it is with experienced actors like Hiroyuki Sanada and Scott Adkins. But the absolute standout is Donnie Yen; his speed and skill are breathtaking as he steals every scene he is in. Unfortunately, despite all of its stunning brilliance, the story takes a lot of shortcuts to wrap up John Wick's story, which disappoints a little. The method to end it all seems like something that would have been mentioned several movies ago. But honestly, who cares? We don't go to a John Wick movie for a deep story. We go for the martial arts and gun-fu, and John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers an unparalleled masterpiece of violence."},{"users":"olcare","ratings":"9","titles":"A great movie that improves the series so much","reviews":"First of all, I went to the cinema as soon as it came out and I must say that it should never be watched outside of the cinema. It's an amazing movie and it's definitely worth watching. Its really really good action movie.From a technical perspective, the film is phenomenal, especially the bird's-eye view scene. My mouth was wide open, it was amazing, and I couldn't get enough of the action. Every fight choreography was well thought out, yes, some parts were exaggerated, but it suited the pace very well. The staircase scene is the biggest example of making these long and single-shot action scenes aesthetic, and it's a great achievement.In terms of acting, I think it was very good. Even though Keanu Reeves played emotionless at times, this role suits him very well. Especially there is one name that fits perfectly, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, he played amazingly and I loved it. Also, Killa, played by Scott Adkins, was amazing. It was one of the most entertaining scenes I've watched in a long time, even though the fight with John was a bit weird, it was fantastic. I watched it breathlessly. I won't mention everyone individually, but the performances were more than enough from the stunt doubles to the one-scene actors.It improves the action of the first 2 films and develops the lack of subject matter or subject matter presentation in the 3rd film, making a very aesthetic mix. They covered the biggest flaw in this series.Also, another good thing was the harmony of the music to the scenes, every music was perfectly fine, which I think increased the pleasure of the action scenes by a click or two.There is not much to say, it's a satisfying, exciting, and aesthetic film. Although it lacks emotionally at times, it never stands out and uses its time wonderfully. I loved the movie, and I highly recommend watching it in the cinema instead of waiting to watch it at home."},{"users":"neilaheaton","ratings":"7","titles":"Solid 7 - extra point for the Warriors tribute","reviews":"It's definitely not the best of the 4.

Scenes of huge ornate mansions\/buildings with hundreds of faceless henchmen to slaughter. Righteous revenge. Blind ninja assassins. Kevlar dinner suits. Fast and the furious level corny. Keanu has about 10 lines the whole movie - but that's a benefit trust me.Do you need to have seen the other 3? Maybe but not essential.

I am now deeply ashamed that I thought that way, because this turned out to be much, much better than what I expected, hell even better than the previous installments (in my honest opinion).This was the 2nd John Wick movie I saw at the cinema and once again, it was an amazing experience. The action was constant. It was relentless, it was bloody and it was just even more constant. I felt like it would never let up. I freaking loved every second of it.

Couldn't wait to watch, since we really liked all the previous ones.First three movies were amazing, they were progressing well, John had deeper and deeper character build, as did other character get, everything went very very good. First three movies were 8-8.5 even 9 at some points.This one was crazy downfall. I can see everyday rating is getting lower and lower and i guess someone payed a ton of people to write similar fake ratings to build momentum until it does what i now think it is made for - make as much money as possible.Nonsense, unrealistic scenes that went stupid, fighting which felt like they are preparing and training for real scenes to be taken, completely brainless involvement of blind man as an ultra killer who as it points in the movie is better than John himself.I mean i can write real real long text about dozens and dozens problems with this movie. We are supposed to have some fantasy level of skills here, but just some level, a believable level, this went way beyond even strongest superheroes strength level at some points and i am not kidding! Its ridiculous!!!Main villain is nonsense, its just so illogical in this universe. I was really really hoping that they can explore that Arabic part of the universe, fighting the Elders stronger snd stronger Elders, really exploring that mysterious part of universe, but no, he kills Elders like they are nothing, and then his main villain becomes young childish egomaniac that basically has no skills and no one knows how or why he reaches ultimate position at the Table. Crazy!!!Ending is rushed as many parts of the movie, and feels utterly disappointing and unsatisfying, only good thing to some degree is scenes with Scott \"unrecognizable\" Adkins.Keanu seems were off for the whole movie, like he has no energy, and he does more than superheroes do in this one, its just cringe after cringe after cringe.

Honestly I thought this movie would try to explain parts of the high table, gangs and why an American homeless man has millions of dollars in paintings stored in a train station in Paris.We heard someone snoring in the cinema."},{"users":"wolfeE-leet","ratings":"6","titles":"Average","reviews":"I didn't see any other John Wick films before seeing this one and had no expectations beyond a gun fight movie starring Reeves.What transpired was an unnecessarily long movie with a script that felt stretched as far as it could go. The first half of the film felt like a serious of contrived action scenes. The Japanese segment droned on for at least twenty minutes just for Wick's old friend to be unnecessarily killed for dramatic effect.Then when the viewer is about to abandon all hope of any central storyline, it's revealed Wick can win his freedom by challenging Illuminati guy to a duel. Fair enough. What followed was another 30 minutes of fight scenes just for our guy to technically qualify for the duel.In the end Wick wins his freedom but he's shot up and presumably dies thereby invalidating the characters whole motivation during the whole film. If death was an accepting ending for him why didn't he just kill himself?Keanu Reeves looks old, tired, and depressed throughout much of this film. He talks slow and at times I wonder if he has early dementia. He's definitely not in his prime anymore and it shows. I'm of the opinion that action stars out of their prime should hang up the gloves and avoid intense action roles. They embarass themselves by providing a less impactful performance than what they were previously capable of.My favorite thing about this movie was the avoidance of shaky-cam. All the action scenes use steady-cam shots which allow the viewer to fully take in and understand the scene. While I didn't like the movie much, I am grateful to have supported (with my money) the continued use of steady-camera."},{"users":"alexpkimel","ratings":"4","titles":"Incredible - As in not credible.","reviews":"John Wick: Chapter 4 sucked. Here's why.1. The characters. Caine is not interesting. There's no way a hitman could be blind and competent at their job. Even for John Wick, a series where the main character can survive multiple gunshots, it's unrealistic. Caine did not have to be blind either. His character could have been a normal hitman and it would've been way more compelling. Plus, he's pretty flat as a person and doesn't have any personality traits. Killa was equally bad. His gimmick of being comically french fell extremely flat and he's pretty annoying. Mr Nobody served no purpose to the story as well.2. The writing. There were plot holes upon plot holes. Even for a John Wick movie it was unbelievable 'Nough said.3. The action was much worse than the other films in the series. John Wick is usually regarded as having realistic action in that the attacks and gun play the characters would do would be based in reality. This was not the case. Enemies take turns attacking John Wick and the hand to hand fight scenes were much less grounded in actual fighting techniques.4. The movie was too long. That's it.5. The beginning was pretty bad, much worse than the rest of the movie."},{"users":"Saoustou88","ratings":"10","titles":"Without Rules We are Animals","reviews":"This film is unmatched, unparalleled and out-skills any action film ever made in the history of cinema...it is in a category of its own. Keanu Reeves is a martial arts badass menace. John Wick Chapter 4 needs no introduction and there are literally NO WORDS to describe the masterpiece that I have just witnessed in the cinema. Which is the only way to see this and do it justice. Part 1 was insane and Chapter 2 was crazy amazing, but I actually skipped Chapter 3 as Halle was very boring in the first hour. However I knew with Bill Skarsgaard as the villain, the Swedish actor known for IT, that this should not be missed as dude can act. Well Lo and behold nothing prepared me for the fight scenes, the BODY COUNT, the 99 lives of John. Donnie Yen is amazing end of story. Keanu is everything. And the cinematography and the locations in Europe are breath-taking...like I watched the most beautiful dream. Lord Jesus Christ the Berlin club scene. The fight sequence on Paris's Arc de Triomphe, speechless. Let's just say that Chad Stahleski gave us violence with a capital V in its most artistic form. He's the Michaelangelo of cinema. Deepness, love, fear and fatigue. Remember the insane fight scene on motorbikes in 2017's The Villainess, a messy Korean revenge masterpiece? Well ALL of John Wicks fight scenes are this but on steroids.

Many apologies because he is one of my favorite people in movies. Notice I didn't say actor in movies as I think that after about 20-30 movies we can all honestly say that his skills have not improved nor have they changed. Having said that I will say that he is enjoyable to watch in movies like this even though I had to suspend my disbelief of my suspension of disbelief on multiple occasions. The story was not very interesting, the bad guy didn't seem very bad nor was I feeling like any of the action scenes made any sense - not that any movies really do. But I wonder just how many times a person needs to place a mag in a loaded weapon and then open the chamber to see if there is a round in the chamber. That was minor because I don't want to spoil alert anyone. I will say this however that if a spin-off is made or another John Wick is made I can honestly say I will not pay any money to watch either. Is Pirate Bay still around?"},{"users":"851222","ratings":"10","titles":"Unbelievable action film (in every meaning of this word)","reviews":"Greetings from Lithuania.\"John Wick: Chapter 4\" (2023) played out the way one could expect from this franchise in term of plausibility. It is unrealistic in every possible way, yet its made in a way that it looks real. And this is the biggest strength of Chapter 4. You have to leave all plausibility at the door before watching it. Because when the movie starts - you are in for one unforgettable ride.Not only Chapter 4 is the best from the 4 movies now, it also puts to shame all action films I've seen in many years. Its incredible movie on purely moviemaking terms. Stunt team, choreography of fights, chases and kinetic cinematography are all put in a way I don't think I haven't seen in Hollywood action film yet. I won't spoil anything, but one particular action set piece near the end left me with my jaw dropped - the way it was filmed looked kinda like a video game but so amazing at the same time. Creators really outdone themselves with this film. And action aside (and there is more then enough of it), i loved how confidently this movie was directed.Overall, \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" is the best action film I've seen in many years. Reminded me of \"Raid 2\" but with bigger scale and way bigger budget. This one has to be seen on big screen - this one incredible action film. And running time almost 3 hours didn't felt draggy - its superbly paced. One of the very best films of the year so far."},{"users":"matthewjones-56423","ratings":"1","titles":"John Wick Officially Jumps The Shark","reviews":"This movie is so bad that I stopped watching it inside the theater to write this review...What happened here?!? I was so excited to see this movie and now I feel so let down. I come to see \"John Wick\" films for the immaculate and creative fight choreography. Do not walk into this movie expecting any of that. All the purism which caused the first three films to shine is gone. The \"John Wick\" franchise has completely disappeared up its own a*s. This goofy underworld the movies created only worked when a normal world still existed in the Wick Universe. But there is no \"real world\" anymore. Every single character in this movie looks cartoonish, like a steampunk caricature of a real person. Even the villains were painfully cartoonish, one of them even sporting a full mouth full of ridiculous gold teeth. I couldn't even look at him without laughing.Now, let's discuss the action and the fight choreography, the two biggest letdowns about this film. This was not just bad fight choreography for the Wick universe, this was bad fight choreography for a straight-to-streaming action movie of the week. As Wick is fighting various henchmen in the ubiquitous club fight scene that goes down in every Wick movie, you can literally see the enemy assailants waiting their turn to attack him. Numerous times, you can clearly see a henchman in the background literally just standing there swinging his weapon at nothing because it isn't his turn yet in the choreography to attack Wick.Also, the \"Gun-Fu\" crap was novel and fun in the first two movies, now it's completely taken over. Rather than the dazzling martial arts, melee weapons, and close quarters combat we've come to expect from this franchise, we're now forced to settle for an endless barrage of gunfire and gratuitous headshots. There is very little actual brawling in this film. It's like the scene in Indiana Jones when he opts to just shoot the sword-wielding henchman rather than actually fight him. \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" is just that scene repeated over and over and over again. Every time a new villain squares off to John and appears that they will be formidable, Wick just shoots them in the head immediately without even so much as a slap fight to satiate our palettes. It gets so boring to watch really fast. I think Keanu is getting up there in years and can't quite bring the fury like he used to; so, the filmmakers decided to just let him shoot everybody rather than fight them.Now, let's go back to the big club scene and talk about how unrealistic this movie is. During the scene, the sprawling night club is packed to the rafters with club goers who appear to be dancing to different music than that which is playing. That's not even close to the silliest thing about them though. As though they were brainless party bots that knew only how to dance, these morons would just stand there gyrating poorly to generic Cyberpunk music while people were being brutally slaughtered by axe right next to them. None of them bats an eye, runs away, or attempts to protect themselves. They just keep on dancing like the NPCs inside a night club on Grand Theft Auto. It was some of the most negligent filmmaking I've ever seen.Simply put, there was no grace to this film and it was a horrible way to end the franchise. To all of you out there saying that this is \"the best action film of all time,\" maybe you should rent \"The Raid: Redemption\" or \"The Raid 2.\" Those are action films done so well they were basically art films. Iko Uwais is the most talented martial arts working in film today. Or, even easier, go rent \"Atomic Blonde.\" As a former ballerina, Charlize Theron was able to memorize in excess of twenty moves at a time, which resulted in the directors needing to cut much less frequently, creating a very seamless, realistic effect to her fight scenes. The director referred to her as belonging to \"the top 1% of actors who can perform their own action.\" \"Atomic Blonde\" is one of the best action films of all time and no one seemed to notice it. Such a crime...Anyway, \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" sucked. You're better off staying home and sticking your head in the oven. Don't waste your money seeing this film in the theaters. It'll be on cable eventually, so just wait for it. This movie is where dreams go to die.

After watching Parabellum, and slightly wondering if the caliber and scope of it can be overtaken, I was gladly mistaken after seeing this film. The IMAX experience was breathtaking and impactful, so if given the opportunity, definitely don't miss out. But, watching it in a regular cinema is also equally good. While I don't want to spoil, I find that the movie felt way shorter than it's 2h 49m runtime, as I felt that Parabellum felt around 20 minutes too long. So if runtime worries you, I can assure you that it is not a problem, but a positive.The movie left me highly satisfied and breathless, so massive props and respect to everyone involved in superseding the other entries and reinvigorating the action genre. It really feels like a once in a lifetime example of a genuinely impactful action movie. Please watch it and I feel that a 10 is worthy simply because of enjoyable nature, which the movie leans into. It does everything an incredible movie needs, and easily makes it one of the best movies as of late, and the apex of this amazing franchise!

Also they keep making fun of the fact that John Wick has no motives to keep going. Then we have a blind Mr. Chow that almost did what hundreds of highly trained assassins with vision couldn't do all together. We have a ton of repeated action scenes from the previous movies and even in the actual movie. For exemple, why bring another assassin with a dog? They couldn't thought of another animal? Why not a bird or something? And the casting of the Marques? The actor is just a french baby.

John sets out to prepare for his war against the High Table, and be free from all this once and for all. However, the job isn't going to be an easy one and all those close to him are caught in the crosshairs and old friends turned rivals are involved in the matter. John wicks' chapter 4 is nothing short of an epic action if the term can apply to action films. Its film it's ushering a fresh light on the genre from its stunts to the fight choreography and high tension. Which continues throughout these movies including this one. The chapter is by all means the best out of the four films since the first. It sets up the situation and throws you off on this thriller of a ride. With the 4th film, not much can be said that hasn't been said about the previous installments. Action is amazing fast paced, and excellent stunt work. Great performance from the cast Keanu Reeves you know him you love as John, Ian McShane, and The late Lance Reddicks. The new cast while Parabellum did a good job of setting up the grand finale. It didn't have the most interesting dialogue. The Adjudicator this woman was not at all interesting and took away a lot of the awe and charm of the mystery of the Table. Here was given Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as The Marquee. He carries more than a traditional shadow figurine showing that this is a guy who has a lot of power calm and is calculated but won't lift a finger and do his dirty work. He's a face you can love to hate So are the side characters Donnie Yen is arguably the best character in the film as he plays a blind swordsman named Cain. He has his reason for wanting john dead, but in many, he's conflicted on the matter. Some of the more somber moments of the film between him and John are compelling. And of course, he's a badass. Fast and on his feet, kind of out stages John in some scenes. They do a very great job and creative ways of showing how he fights.s There's also another guy after John simply called Mr. Nobody who doesn't have any Vendetta against John. He's just a guy trying to collect on John's head., but he's so frequent in the movie and when he's now on screen with his dog he's a charming guy. The visuals are stunningly beautifully shot very well-lit, amazing camera angles. There's one shootout with an overhead view and it's a straight-up video game it's awesome. The only cons that could be made about the movie are the run time. Unlike Parabellum where it just got so carried away with the action that it started to become desensitizing. And the between scenes were lackluster. Here it trying to wrap up the series your gonna want to go all out. Conclude Character arcs and all that. So it's understandable, and I have so invested in the film that it didn't bother me personally.

The story, tho somewhat secondary to the action\/cinematography, is a fitting fourth chapter to this saga. The new characters are the best to be introduced yet out of all the films. Caine, Akira, Mr Nobody and his dog; they are interesting, exciting, mysterious, and above all, badass.The star of the show however is obviously the fight choreography and the cinematography. It's what makes this film. Like the others, this film is drenched in neon style and is clearly influenced by Bladerunner and the like. It's amazing. The long shots, the still shots, the camera angles (that one long bird's eye scene, wow) the lighting. This is truly more than just an action movie. There's an appreciation for elevated filmmaking and the art of film that is on full display here. It's \"elevated action\" if you want to come up with a genre.The fight choreography is unsurprisingly perfect. The amount of jaw dropping kills was ridiculous. You know when someone is just so absurdly cool you can't help but laugh out loud? Every extended fight scene had handfuls of these moments.

The amazing sets and cinematography with all the 'buke' backgrounds have all been done in the three previous films.There is one long fight scene shot from an unusual angle which is the highlight of the film and really stands out, it's about 2\/3 of the way through the film - I thought it was the finale, but no there was a lot more to come, but with that they'd peaked too soon. I spent a lot of the dialogue scenes looking at the the theatre roof - you think I was going to miss a key plot point by ignoring the hokey nonsense?God knows what the 10 star ratings are about.I'd give JW1 a 9, JW2 and 8, JW3 7.5."},{"users":"pauls-25727","ratings":"10","titles":"I have to give it a 10\/10","reviews":"I just have to give this chapter of John Wick 10\/10.

This time our wandering warrior (Keanu Reeves) is out for revenge, but not before the all-powerful \"Marquis\" (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd), who has managed to get those at the \"High Table\" to give him complete control of their global operations, decides to seek some of his own - and that includes trashing the New York hotel and putting \"Winston\" (Ian McShane) out of an home and a job. A rather unnecessary, and fatal, side effect of that activity put's his nose out of joint too; and when the \"Marquis\" turns his attention on Osaka - possibly the last bastion of support for \"Wick\", we just know that we are in for a series of never-ending hand-to-hand fisticuffs that are straight out of a video game. Indeed, for almost all of the action sequences here the whole point seems to be: kill as many of the useless, hapless - but heavily armed - enemy as you can whilst perhaps bleeding a little from the mouth now and again. Use your finely tailored Kevlar suit to deflect bullets, blades, flames - just about everything as you, inevitably, survive against constantly insurmountable odds for well over 2\u00bd hours before a denouement that is, admittedly, quite quirky. That involves a sort of Sacre-Coeur version of snakes and ladders but again, luckily, against innumerable would-be assassins who couldn't hit a barn door with an Howitzer at point blank range. Skarsg\u00e5rd isn't remotely menacing - like a poor \"James Bond\" villain in a perfectly measured suit, Laurence Fishburne features only sparingly and the whole thing has as much jeopardy as the 'Wizard of Oz\" (1939). Reeves does not act here, he performs - and the profusion of CGI, the complete lack of any police or domestic military in Japan, Paris or New York to address the increasingly chaotic and damaging carnage being caused in these locations all just wanted me to start shouting \"thwack\" and \"pow\" at the screen. There is a delightful twist at the end, but it's a very long time in the coming and to be perfectly honest, I was just a bit bored. I've never really been in love with this franchise, it's all too repetitive and predictable - and sadly, this is just the same."},{"users":"gurumachaz","ratings":"3","titles":"Watch the 1st, 2nd and 3rd to understand the inferior 4th installment","reviews":"There's no spoilers here at all.But to those who gave classic 7 to 10 stars review rating are obviously \"anything goes for my popcorn\" sort of audiences.All I'm about to say is simple.John Wick focuses around a man who wants to get out clean.But dragged back by force and circumstances, he is forced to avenge for the fact he can't let go and to not be able to forgive and forget.Forward to this very 4th installment, thinking it would surpass the 1st, or yet the 2nd, well at least the 3rd. But it fail miserably.Miserably.The fights are a mess versus the 3rd installment.Meaningless action choreographed in its worst ever style of fights.What gives it away ? The strength, trust, friendship and long lost signature of John Wick aren't present in this 4th installment.It's just rubbish running about blindly, senseless gunning its way to the end.The raging in John Wick 1st, even the 3rd is simply extraordinary, just not in this 4th chapter.When a man goes through Hell, he drags the Hell long with him but in context of facing his foes, not to ruin the lives of those he pass through seeking guidance, or even solace.To me, they (the filmmakers) simply made him classic evil, senseless, not capable to understand those who surrounds and support him.He is no longer the man who's sent to kill the Boogeyman....and they used \"The Pianist\" Chopin Nocturne C sharp minor to represent Donnie's character ?!

Just a series of set pieces knitted together indoors and outside in different cities, there is no subtlety, knock 'em down ! Next !There is a sequence where viewed from above third person view ,emulating a PC game, a satire on the gaming generation? Also some of the post release interviews there is a score card on how many times a stunt double had been killed.The redeeming part of the film is Wick's backstory and origin family.It is a long film two hours and forty minutes, probably better to stream and pause occasionally, to rest from violence overload."},{"users":"bookchawi","ratings":"6","titles":"Don't disregard the negative reviews","reviews":"Alright, so I saw John Wick 4 last night, and I feel like it's my obligation to issue a fair warning... it is not as good\/perfect as the \"ratings\" want you to believe. Read the negative reviews, they have merit.Before going to see Chapter 4, I rewatched the first 3 and was totally swept off my feet, again! The 4th is a redundant, emotionless, farcical disappointment that fails to advance the story, yet alone resolve it. SO MUCH POTENTIAL after the 3rd one to witness John recover, exact revenge on his betrayers, and peel back the curtain of the high table: doesn't happen. Weak-weak-weak storyline with plot contrivances galore.There is only one action scene that stood out that is maybe the most memorable of the series... and one driving scene with some of the sickest tracking shots I've ever seen... but just be prepared to watch hours of nonsense for those 15 min of magic. But was there cool fighting throughout? Yes, but it falls flat because it is so absurdly unrealistic and tedious without any grounding sense of purpose. Not trying to deter you from seeing it.

It was like watching someone play a Beat Em' Up (or Shoot Em' Up) game where they go through waves of enemies until they get to the level boss. Streets of Rage and Time Crisis come to mind. Anyone who is a gamer and a film buff knows what I'm talking about. In John Wick: Chapter 4 it felt like more of the same.A recurring theme since the third film is that John Wick is given literal plot armor in the form of a Kevlar suit, but also the waves of bullet sponge henchmen he can effectively dispatch with a headshot. JUST. LIKE. A. VIDEOGAME. He can also survive getting thrown off a roof AND fall down five flights of steps. Might as well give Wick a life bar floating over his head.Then there are the dogs with a pencant for biting men's testes and the stock cartoon European Villain of the Week who uses underhanded methods to kill Wick. Russian, Italian, German, French, whatever. They're all interchangeable.Ditto for the largely Asian \"top assassins\" that will pop up to give Keanu Reeves the best choreographed fight scene. And let's not forget the EDM clubs and metro city subways where civilians are largely oblivious to what's going on.All of this stuff is trite and cliche, and I guess this is what people like because it's a break from the superhero fare that has saturated the action movie genre for the past 15 to 25 years.Maybe it's because I grew up in a decade (1990's) where there were still good high-profile films being produced in a sea of higher-profile schlock that my film tastes are hungry for something engaging and thought-provoking, and John Wick 4 ain't it no matter how much people try to pretend that the world these characters live in is compelling."},{"users":"cms-14228","ratings":"1","titles":"Ridiculous, long, boring movie","reviews":"The John Wick movies have run out of ideas and just rehash the other movies.

He's so good he makes Keanu look especially bad. Scott Atkins is great and his martial arts skill shines in this movie.The plot is ridiculous as usual and the killing count is very high.

Being an ardent fan since the release of the first one, I've been cautious going into each subsequent film, waiting to be let down and end my love for the franchise. This movie did the exact opposite. Waaaaay over the top action, infused with a lot more humor and tongue-in-cheek sequences, this movie delivers. So much so, I was disappointed to hear there may not be a fifth chapter (as was originally planned), not to mention saddened by the passing of Lance Reddick.

But there's a comedic humour at how OTT and cringe this movie is that makes it enjoyable to a point, that point is not the length of this! Felt like I was in the cinema for days.The action is repetitive and ridiculous, the main issue is 99% of the individual moments would kill anyone yet these people get up, they use their arms and hands to block bullets but justify it with Kevlar clothing, get hit by 5 cars?

The standout in this department is Donnie Yen, who is phenomenal as Caine; a standard we've come to expect from such a legend in the industry. And of course, our returning characters are all still delightful in this film.John Wick: Chapter Four is one of the most ambitious action films I've ever seen in every aspect. The choreography, pacing, cinematography, production design, blocking are all immaculate. This film is the pinnacle of the franchise; a franchise that is rightfully regarded as among the greatest of the genre. There isn't a dull moment, from start to finish.The runtime may seem daunting initially, but this epic continuation of the narrative truly had me at the edge of my seat with each new sequence. This is the most beautifully shot and choreographed film of the franchise. The film also delivers on the intended emotions throughout. After following John on this journey for four films, we vicariously are as exhausted, triumphant, and fulfilled by the film's conclusion.Chapter Four rivals not only every recent smash-hit film; stands amongst the greatest action films of all time.

This movie really is about nothing other than one scene of shooting violence after another.....prompted by an obscure company....supposed rules.....and obscure families competing with one another over nothing. The main character looks like a homeless person in a borrowed suit the entire movie......who can barely utter simple words like a caveman. This character gets attacked and shot at 50,000 times without injury until some silly duel the writers used for a conclusion. What's disturbing is how a dark movie.....purely composed of violence can get this many stars simply for that....and for an actor that belongs in a surfer movie.

Wick uses an old High Table tradition, but he has to battle through an endless supply of assassins.I'm sure that everyone is saying that the Arc de Triomphe is the best action, but I like the stairs better. With CGI, one is always questioning what is real and what is fake, today. For sure, I see a lot of the Arc action can be real, but one is never sure. The main faking on the stairs is using stuntmen. I don't mind that as long as Keanu does most of it. Also, I like the long takes on the stairs. In fact, I would like the takes to be even longer. That's the best. It's fun to take this franchise to outside and in exotic locations. The action is non-stop. Quite frankly, sometimes it can overload me, but I can't complain.

So let's start. The plot is super simple but really? It's not much. Once again we just have John Wick killing literally armies of people in all kinds of ways. I have no idea how many people he killed, I will probably check a YouTube video, I'm sure someone will make a kill count type video. I have to admit that some kills were very creative, even artistic you could say. I watch the John Wick movies more like a meme than an actual movie. Maybe you wonder why? Well let's face it, the main concept is absolutely ridiculous and doesn't make any sense. You have an old man who is able to fight non stop for hours entire armies and he never dies. When the movie started we had some really cool and creative fight scenes and I got very hyped but you get more and more and more and more fight scenes and the whole thing gets extremely repetitive fast and eventually extremely boring, i wanted to leave the theater at some point.Most scenes are impressive and it's obvious that people worked really hard on them to make every scene and every kill feel intense and unique. I wish they took the time to have a little bit more plot \/ dialogue and less fights. But also many people love the John Wick movies for being exactly that, plotless and full of action, like super full. I still like the whole system of rules these people \/ criminals have and have to follow, like the ending with the whole cowboy-like scene was really cool, felt unique instead of having some really fast paced action scenes. I have to say that the acting wasn't really impressive. John Wick is an emotionless, almost robotic dude that shows no emotion and answers questions with 1 or 2 words. Also the main villain played by Bill Skarsgard, let's say it wasn't much. He didn't realy feel like a threat or a psychopath or anything. His scenes made me feel nothing or cringe. I don't know what went wrong, maybe wrong casting? This villain was ridiculous, an absolute fail. Hiroyuki Sanada was awesome though, I wish he had more screen time.Something I really liked was the music choices with some really cool dark electro and ebm tracks playing. In my opinion if the movie had a little bit more story, more plot, more mystery even, this could have been a masterpiece. It's such a shame because with such good cast you could do great things. But right now to me it is just an ok movie which I don't think I will rewatch ever again. The end will have you believing that John is dead but im sure that if they want to bring him back, they can find many ways to do it. Conclusion: Impressive fight scenes, effects, music, editing, cinematography. Mediocre acting, non existent plot, needs more dialogue, extremely repetitive, boring at times. The John Wick movies don't deserve the hype they get for sure. Just plotless movies for people who want to watch a movie that looks exactly like a YouTuber's gameplay for a fighting \/ shooting game.My rating for Chapter 3 was 5\/10 but I believe that Chapter 4 is a bit better.

The story was a simple continuation of the previous part. The performances by all the cast members were good and memorable.One different and new thing I noticed in this part was that the movie had a lot of emotional elements attached to it. This felt a little bit weird to me as the previous installments only focused on action and nothing else. I faced one more problem and that was the pacing of the movie. The movie felt fast at some moments and slow at other moments, in other words, the pacing was inconsistent.

It's smooth, slick, fast, beautifully put together and keeps you entertained for almost the full 2.5 hours (which is quite long for an action film). Ultimately though, it is just a martial arts film and so if long fight scenes aren't your thing you're probably not going to enjoy this no matter how pretty it is to look at. But if martial arts are your thing, you're in for a visual treat.For what it's worth, I personally found the Osaka scene just a little bit too long. The Berlin one was superb and the some of the action in Paris was quite remarkable - notably the scene shot from above which was really excellent. Also the irony that the Parisien drivers on the Arc de Triomphe were far more lethal than 25 men with guns made me laugh!

Director does a great job in delivering an action film that is creative and entertains.The cast ensemble is great. The music score is awesome. It is one long film but it never slows down and feels fast paced. I am excited to see more sequels. This film does have a great conclusion to the series without giving away spoilers. It tied everything down. But it is one franchise that should keep going. Overall, it is one of the best films this year.

I can watch this atleast a dozen times more.From start to finish, the flow of the story, the character development makes you sit at edge.

Maybe not the flair or skill of Michelangelo but definitely the power and end result. I could go back and just watch that scene and be satisfied with it. Ninja Turtle fans everywhere appreciated it!On to chapter 5? We all know he isn't dead. This isn't our first rodeo.

The first action sequence happens several minutes into the film and you wonder, this is nice, but where is Reeves? Could he be making the extras pull the weight this time instead of doing the action himself? Well nothing could be further from the truth! Once switched on, Reeves delivers immensely, leans in with total commitment, and is an awe to behold. You come here for fabulously choreographed fight sequences, and that is exactly what you get. Long, intricate, and entertaining. The blind man fight scenes are especially superb which is no surprise because we are treated to Ip Man himself, thanks Donnie Yen! Bravo for everyone involved. It is apparent that they put their heart and soul into this! Oh, and check out Rina Sawayama's singing career. What a voice and star power.

Amazing fight sequences, over the top, ridiculous but the film knows that and plays on it. I loved all the films and was a little worried they may have over stretched it with a fourth instalment. I was wrong, it was the icing on the cake. Immensely satisfying and very well filmed. There is an amazing aerial sequence where you see John Wick shoot the bad guys moving through different rooms ( much like a computer game, which I think was its intension). I had the widest smile when it paid a deliberate homage to another classic from the 1970s, The Warriors. If you want Oscar nominated deep and meaningful stuff, this is not for you. If you want an escape from reality and have a great three hours of mindless violence, superb choreography, not much of a story, this is for you. The director has put together a masterclass of an action movie together, the body count alone goes into hundreds and goodness knows how long it took for the actors to do all the stunts.

That being said this is easily the weakest of the saga, the plot is now complete and utter nonsense, disbelieved suspended or not. The new characters that are brought in really don't have any memorable qualities and sorry to say the action scenes (whilst still excellent) don't have the same fluidity or feeling of weight as the first 3, Keanu puts an admirable show on but I think it's safe to say his age is now catching up with him.All in all it's a hard film to critique, if you like John Wick let's face it you're going to watch it and you won't be disappointed by what you find, you just need to turn of any ounce of common sense you have whilst you watch John single handily murder half of France."},{"users":"cedricdumler","ratings":"10","titles":"The magnum opus of action craft.","reviews":"Ecstatic.

[+83%]","reviews":"John Wick: Chapter 4 is everything you can ask for in an action blockbuster, if I were to sum it up. We dive further into the lore of the High Table, the intriguing universe set in motion from the first film gets expanded with new (and significant) characters being introduced, but most importantly, the set-pieces outshine all else. We came for the action, we stayed for THE ACTION (of course!) and the collective brilliance that film offers. And by collective brilliance, I'm referring to the stylistic choices employed in each set-piece, right from a Lawrence of Arabia-like scene in the desert to an incredible showdown at a German nightclub, and the unforgettable stretch of relentless action in that Parisian final act.Chad Stahelski excels in the staging aspect. He is currently at the top of the Hollywood-actioner food chain, and rightly so. The camerawork (by Dan Laustsen, who also shot the second and third outings) is fluid when it's capturing the set-pieces while also treating us to some breathtaking imagery, be it in New York, Osaka, Berlin, or Paris. The aerial frames are straight out of an RPG game, and that particular scene featuring the TTI Dracarys Gen-12 shotgun, looks insane, to say the least. I'd also give credit to the entire stunt department for pulling off that staircase sequence in Paris (good lord!). Also, seeing John Wick simultaneously wield a Nunchaku and a Glock was perfection!Donnie Yen is such a kickass addition to this microcosm, both in terms of delivering high-octane action and playing a character that suits him to the T. Hiroyuki Sanada and Rina Sawayama get to be part of an exciting showdown in Japan, with the latter holding immense potential for the franchise's future. Ian McShane and Lawrence Fishburne pop up during those moments the film needs them the most, offering us smiles and hoots. Shamier Anderson and his \"faithful accomplice\" (a Belgian Malinois, played by five different dogs) are splendid. Also, RIP Lance Reddick (you will be missed!).Scott Adkins, as the quirky-yet-menacing Killa, rises to the occasion as a secondary antagonist, with him beating the crap out of Wick in a stunningly stylized set-piece. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, playing the arrogant (primary) antagonist, is the ideal final boss. The hybrid score by Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard fulfills the task of elevating the fast-paced action, resulting in frequent adrenaline rushes. The ending came off as a bit of a surprise, given there was early news about a Chapter 5. But the post-credit scene leaves enough room for one specific story to continue. Even at 2h 49m, Chapter 4 is fully engaging, leaving no stone unturned from an action-fanatic's perspective."},{"users":"noahpatel-47357","ratings":"10","titles":"Excellent Movie","reviews":"Gave me another reason to hate the French, phenomenal film. My dislike for the french began at a young age when i found out that France existed and they had the same rights as the regular person. This movie contained the exceptionally villainous character of Marquis played to perfection (or as near to it as a french man can get) by the non-french actor Bill Sk\u00e5rsgard. Bill's performance was legendary and will not soon be forgotten by avid enjoyers of the john wick franchise, nor by avid haters of the french. The Marquis being the main enemy of the movie really emphasised the evil of the french population and how they can be evil. However not all french individuals are evil, for example the rat, remy, in ratatouille is a stand up guy and the chef gusteau from the same movie was also a great guy and the imaginary version in remy's mind was an impeccable character. However i still regard the french as lesser men because i have a \"friend\" who is descended from french men and he's annoying, like a French man.So overall i rate john wick chapter 4 a 10\/10"},{"users":"JTReviewsPlus","ratings":"9","titles":"One of the highest kill counts I've ever seen...","reviews":"John Wick Chapter 4 ups the ante in everything you have come to expect from a John Wick movie. The action continues to surprise, the cinematography is visually stunning, the world of assassin's is expanded upon brilliantly, and there are interesting new faces to the franchise that are welcome additions.The variety of weapons, locations, and circumstances John Wick is put through help differentiate Chapter 4 (and even the other sequels) from becoming stale or too repetitive. However, like all the sequels before it, it maintains what makes the franchise so special in the first place. If you are a fan of John Wick you will love this sequel. If you're not a fan then your mind will probably not change.Chapter 4 will definitely do down as one of the best action movie sequels as well as one of the best movies of 2023.

Even at 6 am you'll find the stairs full of random dudes playing djembe and sleepless students drinking cheap beer waiting for the sunrise. It would actually have been fun to include them in the final scene, but what do I know?My real problem with this film though is that JOHN WICK 4 is so detached from any kind of reality it makes it a rightful candidate for the fantasy genre, what with its HIGHLANDER-friendly references to \"consecrated grounds\", love of stylish church interiors and absurdly invincible, nearly-immortal characters. Ok I actually kind of like that part, and I expect new installments to reveal that Da Vinci, Rambaldi (ALIAS) or the Knights Templar started the High Table organization, which would be fun.No, my real quibble is when the gun play becomes so fantastic than they can shoot each other repeatedly at close range and keep fighting as though this were a superhero-type action flick. They lost me after about 15 mn of story when that kind of nonsense started, in Osaka. I did enjoy some brilliant John Woo-like choreography (the overhead sequence shot most of all), but nonsense like that really spoiled the fun for me (and for the Paris audience who giggled when Wick keeps falling down the Montmartre stairs - there's no way this could happen in real life).This is a classic case of sequilitis really, with bigger, louder and absurder as the guiding principles. Give me the same film with fewer set pieces and shorter by an hour and I would be much more satisfied.

A movie still grounded in reality where the protagonist gets knocked out by a baseball bat to the head and when he finds his car stolen and dog killed, he is out for justice.He seems smart, capable, still a bit vulnerable and you feel the stakes he is fighting for and it's a bit like Taken on some strong Steroids.----------------------------This movie is nothing like that, besides al the awesome action (since awesome action it absolutely is). We are now in the MCU!In this movie John Wick falls 222 stairs down and 30 seconds later he is up and running. He's being thrown 10 meters down and also here after 30 seconds he is up and running again. Even Deadpool might be thinking twice before he meets John Wick!He also has to battle Dare Devil, but who decides to battle with swords and guns, but for some reason is not called Dare Devil. He knows exactly where the enemies are and what they are doing when the plots needs him to at other times he has to put in a bit more effort.Also interesting how John Wick wastes a lot of bullets on 3 guys on horses in the desert running in a straight like, while in Paris he precisely headshots people in the middle of the air who are doing saltos after hit by cars. John Wick loves to play with your expectations in how capable you think him to be. One moment he kills 50 people in a minute, the next he has a hard time fighting the gold tooth german King Pin, even though he already hurt him in many ways(even shooting him up the @$$).Also fun to see Morphius again, starting with a grandiose opening, firing things up (for no reason) and we expect a lot from him, since he wanted revenge of how he lost it all. To only show up close to the ending.Also the psychotic party goers in Heaven and Hell in Germany is interesting to see. You see them sometimes looking at all the people being killed around them by guns, swords and axes that are flying around, to then just continue dancing again. Only after the boss has been killed, everyone is suddenly aware that they need to get out of there.So if you just turn of your brain and look at the spectacle, you are in for a treat. Also the cinematography and music is really nice."},{"users":"sehestedlasse","ratings":"1","titles":"Worst movie ever","reviews":"Such a bad movie. 3 hour long fight where John has put on \"godmode\".

However, that's not to say that this movie comes without its flaws. Because even with its overlong runtime weakening the actual product, there's still some other issues that block it from ranking higher than the first film.But if you've paid the entry fee with a craving mainly for kick-ass action with Keanu Reeves at the centre, visually striking direction and with a lack of care for sensical plot, you're in luck. Although each are usually several minutes too long, this film is loaded with the most distinctive and hooking combat fight scenes located throughout the entire franchise. For many, watching John Wick brutally shoot up a bunch of bad guys in a very stylistic fashion is entertaining, but the amount of damage taken by the characters is also where one of the film's most distracting plot holes roots between.The reason a lot of the action scenes are all-fun-with-no-suspense-or-excitement is because it seems that damage and brutality doesn't really apply to John Wick, where everyone else he fights typically dies at the instant. He can go tumbling down a humorously long staircase and get shot or stabbed, but he can always get back up with seemingly no impact from the injuries. The motives presented by the characters is also a sizeable issue, giving the movie what feels like so many convoluted purposes to the point where the whole project could've just been thrown away and forgotten.Some will agree that within the context of a film review, the critic needs to get the positives in first and finish with the flaws. This review doesn't follow that order because John Wick: Chapter 4 is still a decent action-thriller you'd want to leave off on a good note from. Anyway, this film is definitely the best of the sequels due to the fact that's it's entertaining, more distinctive, the writing is much better and there's surprises along the way to await for. It may have a runtime of nearly 3 hours, but it always feels like the plot is always moving forward, even if it gets a bit ridiculous at times. Performances by Keanu Reeves, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, Scott Adkins and Donnie Yen also deliver some of the effect. If this is the finale to the overrun franchise, this is a solid way to come to an end.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."},{"users":"lazygetter","ratings":"5","titles":"Meh.

The runtime is just padded with action that isn't that great. It's like a damn video game. Come on. The first John Wick is the best purely because the action feels real.The plot is also sorta weak. Few characters are not required at all for the plot to happen. Why did they need the whole blind angle? Why go the Daredevil path? WHY?! The tracker character was not required too. His presence didn't change the plot in any way at all.The fight scene, with the drone, before the end is basically a video game scene. Gotta be kidding me. As the ending scene developed, it was kinda predictable too. You mean tell me a god damn blind assassin is better than everyone else ? They are openly mocking us for giving them money for making dumb plots.I wouldn't have felt bad if I had skipped it. I am a huge John Wick fan.

I suspected that this trend had been pushed to it's breaking point.It seems that Chad Stahelski may have agreed. While \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" does not retreat from the mythology the series has created, it really stops the expansion and returns to a relatively streamlined plot and a manageable set of characters.It may seem ridiculous to call a three hour film streamlined, but this film more than earns it's run time by creating a series of epic action sequences that are some of the best ever committed to film. These sequences are long ... very very long ... but they are never less than utterly engaging. They tell stories in miniature and are wonderfully tense and dynamic. Honestly, you have to turn to action films made outside of the United States to see action this good.The rest of the film does not let these sequences down. The plot is fairly simple and moves along rapidly. The new cast members are all great. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd is a great villain. Donnie Yen demonstrates that he should be in dozens of Hollywood films.

It wasn't even disguised that the plot is completely unnecessary and that every really cool backdrop, stylish villain, mystical dialogue is just filler for the ambiance. Mass murder takes place and bystanders don't even bother to take notice. They are just background dressing for the endless, nonstop choreographed fighting.Don't get me wrong. The sets are beautiful. The wafer thin characters whom you know nothing about act cool. The dialogue about The Table and each other are mystical in a bad karate film kind of way. I had a hard time knowing whether this was just a parody of those films. And in the end, which is itself another endless fight that is clearly over the top (and our hero seems totally invulnerable like playing a video game in god mode), we have another end which... will there be another sequel?I really miss the cool, badass with a couple of witty lines we saw from the first two. In this film, the only words I recall Reeves saying were a handful of items about the dead and... \"yeah.\" Sums it up."},{"users":"baumbach-86824","ratings":"3","titles":"Why are they allowed to call this John Wick???","reviews":"Absolutely not the best of them. Maybe the worst. Painfully unrealistic, everyone wears literally bulletproof smokings and the elite guys were recruited out of gardeners, tax attorneys and university professors judging by their skill to kill with weapons. When in the first movie John shot each enemy a bullet in the head he now often feels the need to use 3 bullets (but sometimes they still stand).As much as I enjoyed the very first John Wick movie as bored I felt during these extremely long and uninteresting fighting scenes. He is as immortal as Iron Man and with this leaves all excitement.And it seems as if the directors were mocking the franchise by letting John fall out of the 4th floor, getting run over by cars, falling down literally 222 steps (I know because they mention it) of a staircase and all of it just leads to some short heavy breathing but it's forgotten just 3 seconds later.None of the characters have personality. Keanus text was probably printed on half a page and mostly consists of 2 syllabus-responses or the name of the person he's just looking at.I really like and appreciate Keanu as a person and actor. I just wish the director would have taken this movie serious. I wouldn't want to rewatch even 10 minutes of this letdown of a movie. And it makes me strongly think that most of those 9 or 10-star ratings are bought while I am writing this comment on the first opening weekend."},{"users":"erwinrnasution","ratings":"9","titles":"13\/10","reviews":"\"Action Movies: John\"Erwin Nasution"},{"users":"Olivier_Lacelle","ratings":"5","titles":"Extremely disappointed !","reviews":"Maybe my expectations were too high. Maybe It was a mistake to bingewatch the three previous movies beforhand. But my two friends and myself are unanimous after watching the movie durong a premiere : it was BAD. I mean, REALLY BAD.SPOILERS ALERT.Where do I begin. The movie starts with a plan in a dark room with Keanu hitting some board to train himself and Morpheus, euh I mean Laurence Fishburne's Hobo King character telling him it's time. And then... we almost didn't see him for the rest of the movie. It doesn't make any sense since he was the main ally John Wick could count on at the end of the third movie. In fact, nothing makes sense in this movie afterwards !Right after, he's teleported in the desert, chasing guys on horse, and he kills the wiseman just like that. Why ? There are so many characters there that doesn't have any purpose in the story, like the mercenary and his dog. Same for the Father and his daughter in Japan. John Wick travels all over the world but we don't even know why.The main antagonist... oh my god. Take all the clich\u00e9s you can find on the french aristocracy and put it in one guy, and you got this movie's villain. Onlike any other villain of the franchise, he's not even scared a little bit of John Wick, not until the very end... when he choses a blind guy to do a pistol dual with John. Yeah right !Almost everything that made the previous movies so good is thrown away : the lights and colors, the rythm, the scared villains, the original choregraphies of the fights, etc. Another element that is lacking : John Wick's pain. This time, he doesn't look tough and resilient, with sheer will and tenacity. He just look stupididly invincible and invulnerable. He can get it by a car 5 times, fall from 5 stories, or from 222 stairs... no problem at all ! He's not even slightly injured. It's just ridiculous !At some point, people in the theater were laughing and it was clearly not supposed to. My friend fell asleep and I was looking at my watch. Oh and if you know Paris, you realize the traject he follows is absurd.I don't know if it's a coincidence but it seems that they changed the scenarists for this last installment. I've also read that the original version before cut had a near 4 hour lenght.

Somehow the fourth entry in the John Wick saga is the best one. This movie has no right being as good as it is. Seriously, this film has some of the best action sequences, gun play, hand to hand combat, and practical effects seen in a while. The action\/fight sequences are done in long takes, gleefully violent, gracefully over the top, relentless pandemonium, and a complete assault on all the senses. It's pure, unadulterated mayhem and fun.The cinematography is gorgeous to look at with awesome shots thrown in. Biggest complaint is the movie is a little too long; almost three hours. But that goes by quite quickly even though it just drags in a couple of scenes. The fight choreography is something Jackie Chan would be very of to make. Keanu Reeves does a great job with his fight scenes and he is pushing fifty but acts like he is in his twenties. Bill Skarsgard (Pennywise from \"It\") pulls off a sadistic villain mixed in with great performances from Donnie Yen (his character is blind but still kicks ass) and Shamier Anderson with his beloved mutt.It's not quite a masterpiece; but delivers a pure, adrenaline filled cinematic experience. The coolest sequence is the birds eye view of the fire dragon breathing shotgun shootout. The stunt team also deserves a big shoutout. Definitely go see this on the big screen and heavily suspend your disbelief. Then sit back and enjoy the frenetic, over the top, blood soaked ride."},{"users":"vivekmadireddy","ratings":"1","titles":"Most nonsensical movie ever","reviews":"I have never written a movie review ever but I am compelled to write this one.

Even in the theater people were going wild every time John Wick wrapped his leg around some henchman's head, flung him to the ground and then got the headshot, so it's no surprise to see the same online.But for me it was repetitive. The bad guys always conveniently come in waves like it was a video game, they stagger around while he's fighting waiting for him to recover and then they strike, nobody can seem to shoot him (he kept holding his kevlar jacket up to his face but his arm and forearm were fully exposed as he did so), I could go on.John Wick has more plot armour than James Bond, Jason Bourne and Denzel in The Equalizer put together.Fell 20ft directly on his spine...gets back up.Fell 30ft directly on top of a car...gets back up.There's next to no plot. He wants out and he has to kill his way out. Which he does. Of course he does. And then he dies. That's it.I liked the Japan scene but everything after that was like watching the same thing over and over."},{"users":"W011y4m5","ratings":"7","titles":"Empty.","reviews":"\"John Wick: Chapter 4\"; nearly 3 hours of relentless & increasingly elaborate set pieces (impressively realised & captured on screen by DoP Dan Laustsen in particular - channelling Ridley Scott & Jordan Cronenweth's \"Blade Runner\" in some genuinely awe inspiringly lit, moody, noir sequences), boasting astonishingly inventive fight choreography, cinematography & stunt work, blending practical FX & photorealistic VFX to create a sleek aesthetic that's surprisingly convincing etc. Is admittedly interesting for the first 120 minutes (entertaining with sheer creative ambition), yet by the conclusion, the pace slows to a jarring crawl, the movie veers in to a tedious sense of self indulgence & I gradually came to the realisation that the film had unfortunately begun to out-stay its initial welcome, sticking around long enough for viewers such as myself to start questioning the logic of what they were watching (out of boredom; for instance, where are the police & why are all these bloody massacres across major cities & landmarks not sparking mass reported, international \/ diplomatic incidents \/ manhunts?) - which (in & of itself) is therefore far too long - meaning it probably should've been cut down further in the edit, for concision.However, unlike \"Chapter 3\" (an installment I vehemently disliked, purely because it felt like a vacuous & self congratulatory prelude to the finale, prioritising obligatory world building & expansion without really taking the time to create a self sustaining structure - to justify a widening scope), the latest sequel does finally progress with a strong sense of direction (chickens coming home to roost & seeds sewn finally being harvested), giving the impression as though the plot threads are intertwining with one another & culminating to form one neat bow (tying up loose ends) - but when the entire thematic premise is built upon the need to stress the importance of a plot's narrative \"consequences\"... Ironically, this lacks any - so the result feels a tad hollow \/ insincere.Using the action as an example; since Chad Stahelski never analyses the impact this gratuitous violence has on innocent bystanders caught up in the crossfire (though conflict's regularly involving or taking place amongst civilians), despite the grandiosity of what we're witnessing, there are very little stakes for us to emotionally invest ourselves in - due to the fact that there seems to be hardly any impact to anything unfolding.As comparisons, \"007\" or \"Mission Impossible\" (similar franchises which essentially succeed in emulating the same formula - to greater effect; revered assassin \/ spy jets around the globe to bring down a nefarious organisation) at least have the courtesy to explore the accidental ramifications of their protagonist's behaviours (helping to ground the story in something authentic & real whilst simultaneously challenging the flawed identities of the iconic lead by questioning the moral ambiguity of each individual, seeing how they respond to collateral, demonstrating why the perspective whose eyes we follow things through are ones we should care about etc.), yet this doesn't; John apparently exists in a hermetically sealed bubble, devoid of exterior interaction - where damage is contained solely within the confines of the elusive \"Table\", rendering events as superficial & trivial - when the destructiveness of consecutive clashes serves no discernible purpose - other than for the sake of it.The literal opposite (& a blatant contradiction) of supposed \"consequences\".Then there's a secondary reason to disengage; the lack of clear intent driving \"Mr Wick\" forward. Any writer knows that although a fictional creation may not have to be very likeable, they must be relatable or sympathetic in some way, shape or form - to ensure we're somewhat \/ partially invested in their emotional journey; the method in which a character chooses to react might be perhaps disproportionate (after all, art's entire point is to spark debate from subjectivity & we learn empathy through comprehending choices which don't align with our own) so (to quote \"Dr Manhattan\" in Zack Snyder's \"Watchmen\": \"without condoning, or condemning\") I understand... But again, here, there's nothing.In the first (co-directed by David Leitch), we were presented with a standard (serviceable) revenge flick rationale; his puppy's murdered & considering the sentimental value assigned to the dog, his quest for retribution led to swift & brutal vengeance - whereas here? Comically, the screenplay seems nonethewiser; continually, Keanu Reeves' title role's associates often ask \"to what end?\" & the answer is never actually provided.Heck, even during one verbal exchange of dialogue, the antagonist subtly states men can be separated in to 3 categories: \"those who have something to live for, those who have something to die for & those who have something to kill for\" before announcing his nemesis (our main guy & the reason for him being an enigma) has \"none of those things\"... So being devoid of sufficient motivation to plausibly explain any further development (or any visible carnage), his characterisation feels stilted & one-note, dragged out for the remainder of the run-time, offering no satisfying arc... Simply churning out more of the same, on a larger scale & with less heft, conveying a lot whilst also failing to merely articulate slightly a little.There's an abundance of glossy style (to compensate) & the ridiculously high quality of it's indisputable... But when the blockbuster is entirely reliant on that - to retain attention? There's far less than it would have you believe."},{"users":"mjavsny","ratings":"5","titles":"Wow what a bummer","reviews":"So.... I thought I loved JW. I certainly love the first one. Imo, the first JW is one of the best action movies of all time. It was a story with heart - it had a reason for being. And I realized about myself, what I love most in a movie are the parts where you a) discover the protagonist's \"powers\" b) learn about a new world and 3) real people doing extraordinary things. That was my JW, the Baba Yaga. A legend brought back to life because someone stole his car and took his dog. Perfection.Fast forward till now and over hours of my life, JW has eroded into some kind of cartoon. The man should be in a full body cast at all times but no, he just bounces around like a rubber ball, seemingly mad at himself at certain points because he keeps getting back up. The premise of JW is that he's an extraordinarily TALENTED man - not Wolverine - yet he is now a superhero. And much of this movie didn't make sense - why wasn't his rage directed at Winston?!? He was the one who betrayed him in the 3rd movie. His reasons for all his actions aren't compelling at all any more....in reality, if he's THIS MAD he should be going after the cancer research centers that didn't save his wife.If all that you ever loved about JW is the shooting, well, this will be your jam.

The first three were great, albeit gradually declining in quality throughout the series. I was excited and hopeful for the fourth installment but couldn't have been let down more. The action was boring by mid film and there was still another hour and a half to go at that point. This movie is ten minutes shy of three hours long. The fight scenes go on way longer than they need to, moves are repeated over and over and the plot armor of JW becomes laughable. If you like the film because John is a regular guy with crazy skills, you'll hate this. If you see him as some kind of superhero then you'll probably enjoy it.

I'm a huge Keanu fan as well as the Wick character. However, this 4th installment left me wanting and at times checking the clock during the show. You have probably already read that the action and fighting is good. It is, but it's not new or innovative. Assuming you've seen the first 3? There's guns, hand to hand, cool use of the environment, lots of bullet proof clothing and ineffective hits, a dog and some of the other Wick tropes. I guess I was expecting another new style or sweet scenario. I enjoyed the movie, but was expecting a Wick experience and instead got a, 'quest for more money' type of vibe where the scenes and situations seemed repetitive. I suggest seeing the flick, just temper your expectations and hope they don't unequivocally jump the shark on a 5th.

(Even people saying that its the best chapter!) Sadly I couldn't figure out exactly why.The first and the biggest problem in my opinion is that the film includes close to none character development. For me, a John Wick movie must, and I say this again, must make you eager for the thought of John Wick taking his revenge from other villians. However in this movie sadly all you get is unlimited bodies thrown at John and no sense of that anger and fury.Another problem is that the film is absurdly unrealistic. Of course we all know that John Wick movies are supposed to be unrealistic to some degree but this one makes you want to leave the theater... The cringe caused physical pain on my body.The last thing I want to mention is that the movie didn't feel like a sequal to any chapters. There are so many new characters that you actually get lost. Honestly you could go watch it without seeing any of the chapters and have little to none problem understanding the story. Sadly it felt completely like a different movie in a bad way.TLDR: Worst chapter of the sequal. Unrealistic, and boring. No sense of the John we know of. Too much action and not enough story.

Its atmosphere is stunningly energetic, feeling lived-in and full of unique style. This is especially attributable to an expert utilization of lighting and color, as well as a blast of a soundtrack and intense score that ramps up tension. This lays a foundation for what makes all of these films so special: the action. So much is done to make these scenes so perfect, the beautifully choreographed fights proving masterfully edited. The sound and sound editing are additionally excellent, aiding some of the most creative fights of the entire genre. The ensemble convincingly sells this fast-paced action, too, highlighted by Reeves, Yen, and Sanada. All three have standout sequences, often with one another. This trio, as well as McShane, Skarsg\u00e5rd, and Anderson, share great chemistry in their spot on performances. The central and supporting cast a like are very intriguing, developed to have differentiable characteristics that form around some sort of emotionally resonant core. Importantly, then, the film leads to an extremely satisfactory resolution. While the picture is not perfect, mainly a result of early pacing issues, it cements itself as a must watch for any fan of action or cinema itself.

But that's about it.The whole act with John wick in Tokyo was pure BS, and get this - If you edit out that whole situation in Tokyo the story doesn't change even one bit. Literally has ZERO weight for why it has to be in the film. The stunts in that sequence were definitely off and you can see Keanu struggle in those parts.The movie does pick up after 01hr:40min mark and is really enjoyable as it gets to the end.

At least the previous part has some good action sequences even though it doesn't have a story. A nice touch of a gentleman's conversation and nice cinematography.

This chapter is probably the weakest, by the way. It feels extremely repetitive. I had to rewatch the trailer to make sure I was not going to pay for the same movie I had already watched.

The overhead cam shot scene in the old building was revolutionary and expertly choreographed. The negotiation for the specifics of the dual was wonderful too.The idea of a blind assassin was also fresh and the ultimate dual scene was very well handled.However, much of the rest was so repetitive it became not only boring to watch but irritating. Watching the same gun, knife, roll, fall etc 150 times is just pointless and boring.The penultimate scene of JW getting up the steps to the dual was painful beyond belief. I mean come on ffs!! We've watched him spend the last half hour moving a mile and kill 200 men...just get there already.JW 1 was so fresh and new its sad that we have now ended up with an hour of amazing cinema and nearly 2 hours of what looks like a kid playing a first person shooter.Maybe the US audience love this stuff but for the brits it would be nice if they could edit out about an hour of the repetitive and unbelievable nonsense as it had so much promise and yet fell so short.Usual problem of studio giving production total freedom to do what they like.

John Wick must do whatever it takes to talk to the high table into fighting for his freedom to be a free man in Chapter 4.Overall, I loved every single minute of the story in this film. There was no slow parts at all and the film keeps on letting the viewer thirst for more action until the end. The choreography was amazing with the amount of action and stunts they did in the film. It was glad seeing returning characters such as John Wick (Keanu Reeves), Winston (Ian McShane), Charon (Lance Riddick, R. I. P), and Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne). Loved the new characters as well such as Caine (Donnie Yen) and Bill Skarsgard's character as the main antagonist.

John Wick 2 was also a really good movie ( In my opinion ) After John Wick 3, it starts to lean more and more towards the action side and not focus so much on everything else.John Wick 4 is a relatively long film. I think a total of 2 hours just fighting and shooting duels.John Wick becomes a bit too much of a superhero in the sense that he lives being run down countless times, falls 20 meters onto the edge of the roof of a car. And the sequels he gets up and walks away.What I liked about the old movies is that he was Badass but it was still realistic. He kills 150 people in John Wick 4. It's becoming too much of a superhero movie for my taste.Another thing that I thought was mysteriously thought by the director. Is that when they shoot and throw axes at each other's heads in a nightclub, almost no one reacts to it.And when they shoot with machine guns and other weapons in the middle of the road around The Arc de Triomphe are there no cars that speeds up or slows down. It is as if they are not there at all.John Wick 4 is like riding a roller coaster. It's fun at first, but at some point, you just want to get off the ride.I give it 5\/10 due to the fact that it manages to make a decent story for it's 4th of a franchise.And because I love Keanu."},{"users":"williamsong-19226","ratings":"9","titles":"Darn it I missed the post credit scene!","reviews":"Great action, love Reeves and Yen.

The whole Osaka scene was great, seamlessly incorporated bow and arrow into the movie, who knows bullet proof suit can't withstand arrows? But if you think about it it could actually make sense. Paris scene was a bit chaotic, to me it felt a bit too blatant. It's supposed to be a secret society. In previous titles when Wick fights off killers it's been mostly discrete, or at least they try if I remember correctly. NOT IN PARIS. Swarm of killers just hunt Wick openly, might as well do it in broad daylight. Kinda break immersion if you ask me. Also, I'm not sure what's the purpose of the existence of Mr. Nobody, it's an interesting character for sure but felt a bit out of place. The writings failed to incorporate him and elevate him to plot significance. The movie would work with or without him, such a pity because I really like the character, he has a lot of potential to be greater. Last but not least, the main antagonist is just some typical spoiled brat, don't get me wrong the acting was on point, but the character himself is kinda boyish and weak, not a charismatic and strong antagonist I hoped for.

Terrific additions of new characters are welcomed and some of them really steal the show. Do you remember the dogs? Well, they were not forgotten on this one and for sure the bar was raised again. A lot of scenes looks like taken from a graphical novel, so well performed and choreographed that a bow goes to the director. The locations are stunning and is good to see that finally we have another Cameron to do night scenes. All of them so well illuminated. Fantastic. Actions sequences everywhere and all of them exciting and fast paced. The villains are really good and surprising, making this well entertained. Sound is terrific and colors are superb. This must to be seen in big screen. Almost three hours that run like feather in the air. A solid 9\/10 for me, i give a 10 to compensate some 2-3 stars that clearly are trolling the rate without a proper reason. If you looking for action, look no further. This is the one, at least until Mission Impossible arrives, and that movie will need to be quite good if want to take from Mr. Wick the title of Action Movie of the year."},{"users":"demolution-17666","ratings":"10","titles":"Keanu Reeves still has it!","reviews":"For someone who is middle aged, Keanu Reeves can still move as good, along with Donnie Yen (whos to be expected, from his martial arts experience).There were a few scenes that was slow, however made sense, as it caught up.With Donnie Yen in the movie as well (Caine), wow seeing Donnie and Keanu fighting against each other was a dream come true.One thing i can say about Donnie Yen, there's a certain scenes, which I was shocked about (good way) and laughed.There maybe some slow scenes, but it pays off with the action and you won't be disappointed with the fight scenes, the director made sure of this.I won't spoil it, please do see this at the theatres - it's worth the wait, almost 3 hours."},{"users":"sbweightman","ratings":"6","titles":"John Wick vs the cyborgs","reviews":"A bullet ballet with lots of overly long action scenes full of complex fight choreography. It looks and plays out just like a videogame - the protagonist defeats an overwhelming number of enemies, shrugs off damage like it is nothing and bystanders either don't exist or act oblivious to the ensuing violence. The setting always required a suspension of belief and realism, but this one with its bullet proof suits and vehicle fight scene was ridiculous. The settings are opulently stylish, the characters are outlandish and the plot is refreshingly simple, but it all felt a bit too silly this time around.

It is a full on barrage on the senses. You'll leave the theatre full of adrenaline and with your ears ringing.As this franchise is now the gold standard for cinematic action, it seems apt to start with the action set pieces. They are superb and there are so many of them. In fact, this film is basically four half an hour long action sequences with 10 minutes of plot in between each of them. Each of the sequences is brutally shot with creative camera work and extended takes. The stunt work is outrageous. The variety is thrilling. Just when you think an action sequence must be done, it goes on and on and on. Almost to the point of too much but it dances that fine line very well.As mentioned there isn't an awful lot of plot considering this is a nearly 3 hour movie. A lot happens, but it is mostly played out through action rather than dialogue. Still, it is a well crafted story. It follows from the previous film well and builds out the legend of John Wick world very effectively.The additions to the cast are all brilliant. Hiroyuki Sanada, Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsgard, Rina Sawayama are all excellent in their roles and each bring something so distinctive and engaging.As you'd expect based on the last couple of instalments, stylistically this film is a treat. Chad Stahelski is a master of his craft and knows how to present a beautiful film.Personally I think Chapter 3 is still the best of the franchise, but there really isn't much in it. This latest instalment will have any action directors out there quaking in their boots. How are they going to top this? I doubt they will."},{"users":"trevor_alex","ratings":"10","titles":"Simply sensational !","reviews":"Where to start ?

The German-Club scene. The Paris-car scene. The shotgun-onetake scene. The Paris-stair scene. The dog scenes. The duel scene. And of course those little partly funny partly crazy scenes (for instance the dog pissing on somebody's face after demolishing him or the arrow in the knee upside down scene).Every character is perfectly selected.

There is a rabid group of movie-going watchers that are looking for the intimate details and Easter Eggs to further their immersion into this world while the rest of the movie going public has probably moved on and, just might, check it out on a whim.Such is the case with JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 - the 4th installment of the Keanu Reeves led\/Chad Stahelski Directed series that is long on style, action, intrigue and mythology while being low on logical plot-lines and...well...daylight.But this won't matter to the John Wick movie-goer. They are getting more of the same - cartoon violence professionally created by Stahelski and Reeves with plenty of bad guys battling (and losing) to Wick while the mysterious, underground society that Wick has run afoul of tries to take him down.This insider intrigue will be enriching for the true John Wick fan but will be inconsequential for the casual movie-goer as these plot machinations are just an excuse to line Reeves up against seemingly insurmountable obstacle after seemingly insurmountable obstacle.And what a journey it is. Starting with a tussle at the Osaka Continental (featuring veteran Martial Artists Hiroki Sanada and Donnie Yen) to a battle in Germany to the final in Paris, JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 is just one, long stylized fight sequence with both Stahelski (the Director and Fight Choreographer) and Reeves (as Wick) showing off their talents in new and interesting ways.There are way too many fight sequences to mention, but there is one sequence in a building that is shot from on high (reminiscent of watching video game play) that is the most interesting\/effective - but they all are a ton of fun.Bill Skarsgard (Pennywise the Clown in the IT movies) is along as the Marquis (cool name) who is in charge of bringing Wick down. He is joined by the always good Clancy Brown (the voice of Mr. Krabs on Spongebob) on the \"bad guy\" side while Wick regulars Ian McShane, Lawrence Fishburne and the late, great Lance Reddick line up on Wick's side.It is a fun roller-coaster ride - if a bit long at almost 3 hours (the middle sags a bit) - that will entertain casual fans of action flicks while satisfying the hard-core \"Wick-aphiles\" (if that is a term) with a further peeling back of a layer of this world.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"},{"users":"Padreviews","ratings":"4","titles":"John Wick 4 stands for 4\/10","reviews":"If you've seen John Wick 3 you'll know this doesn't have to do much to be a better filmIt achieved that , it's a better filmAs an advert for a game it did really well tooPositives were , slick fight scenes , music and sound was top notch .Negatives far too long there's no excuse for making a film 3 hours long , no film should be longer than 2 hours unless it's a true epic , exceptions are Lawrence of Arabia & Ghandi - those films have a story to tell .John Wick 1 was brilliant they could have ended up there but if you can make a film for $100m and make $200m then it's clear there will be a John Wick 5 .If you enjoy films like Blade with Wesley Snipes you'll enjoy this , in fact with all the marvel films around I'm surprised they haven't brought out a Blade 4 with a new actor after the success of Black PantherLike James Bond's immortality it doesn't matter what you throw at John Wick he's not going to dieBest acting goes to Scott Adkins absolutely superb as Killa in a fat suit I actually thought it was Tom Hardy at first !

And it is pretty clear that the makers of Chapter 4 have not delivered on those promises.First, we saw no real plan from John Wick or Winston or The Bowery King (Lawrence Fishburn) to take on The High Table or The Elder. A couple characters (Winston being one of them) actually point this out, and John Wick's only answer is, \"I'm going to kill them.\" But that doesn't solve his problem: the High Table isn't just going to stop.Second, i was IMMENSELY disappointed that Lawrence Fishburn did not have a more central role in this chapter. The ending of Chapter 3 suggested that this vendetta and war against the High Table was as much his as it was John Wick's. It would certainly have made for a far more interesting plot to have the Bowery King's forces join with his royal counterpart in Paris or Berlin or Osaka or wherever in order to fight The High Table.And lastly, the fight scenes were quite ... well, boring. Just the same shoot-shoot-shoot, thrust, stab, flip enemy over shoulder, shoot or stab until dead. Then repeat ad nauseum.Also, John Wick is not a superhero with mutant superpowers. When he falls 30 feet and lands hard on his midsection, he should be hurt. Badly. Or even be dead. His ability to keep getting up and never get get hit by a bullet just seemed contrived and sloppy.I had hoped for a bigger and cleverer send-off for this story."},{"users":"dannylee-78082","ratings":"8","titles":"Such is life","reviews":"My weekend ended with finishing the final installment of the John Wick series. I must say that I am glad that they decided to go out on a high note. I heard rumors about a 5th one and that would not have been a smart move.The movie has many weaknesses. I found the story to be quite convoluted when it should have been pretty straightforward. I wish they actually showed people sitting at the High Table. It felt tiring for him to chase a ghost-like group of people with no tangible existence. But at the same time, the elder in the beginning was killed off so easily. Does this organization even matter? I feel like that's a pretty serious offense but they treated him the same as last time with about the same amount of force. Furthermore, the whole \"tracker\" role seemed absolutely pointless. He was not needed in this movie and his ambiguous stand against John Wick confused me throughout. I also found Donnie Yen's role slightly underwhelming. I understand he is blind but sometimes it felt like he didn't have that good of a hearing to compensate how well he could fight. It also made zero sense for them to be put into a duel like that if he's blind... I am suspecting that they purposefully didn't kill each other for the best outcome. John would never miss a shot given his track record. Not to mention that this possibility of the duel just being introduced when I feel like the concept would have ended the series in two movies had it been known to the audience earlier. It also seemed that John was much more invulnerable in this movie. I remember that in the previous movies, he suffered wounds. However, I don't remember him bleeding much up to the final scene. I had to suspend my beliefs many time because whoever came up to him felt so incompetent. Maybe I need to get completely immersed in more to be able to fully experience genres like this.However, I think visually this film was possibly the peak of action films. It was beautifully shot (the aerial scene was absolute pinnacle of this) with vibrant colors of the underworld. Very impressive shots here and there with the changing lights. I also thought the choreography was improved. They had many creative sequences, especially in Paris with both the Arc de Triomphe and the stairs scene. The movie also showcased recurring motives like underground club fights and crotch-biting dogs. These were some nice moments for the fans and I appreciated being able to pick them out while not being predictable.While I would have normally not given a movie like this such a high rating, I wanted to commend the decision of killing off John here. Our hero does need to rest here because he's technically free of his obligations (but all it took was one duel!). I appreciated his character arc development over the four movies. He's finally reached a point in his life where he felt like his life was complete because I am sure he could have lived if he tried to as his wounds didn't seem that bad and he's survived worse. He chose to leave his legacy as \"loving husband\" while that was a small fragment of his life. He wanted to continue living to remember his wife but perhaps he wanted to join her side because he is tired of living with the weight of his memories and consequences.I understand the praise and where it comes from but perhaps I have preferences in genres. As I continue with my reviews, I wanted to be a person that can give equally high scores on the pinnacles of different genres. But I would probably never come back to this series and those movies have to have a ceiling in their ratings."},{"users":"angelosbitoratos","ratings":"9","titles":"Without a doubt the best action movie in the 21st century","reviews":"Coming in the 4 installment of the John Wick series with everything that has happened in the previous 3 I was wondering what was going to happen in this one. And boy it was magnificent. Keanu Reeves had already solidified himself as a legend through the Matrix series but with the conclusion of this movie he overcame whatever he did while acting as Neo. The choreography was the best I've ever seen in any action movie and it never felt boring. For a movie almost 3 hours long it never got boring you were always hyped up about what's going to happen next. The camera work was phenomenal following Wick to iconic places such as Japan, Sahara Desert(probably),Paris,Berlin,New York etc. But what I really appreciated about this movie was that despite having less dialogue than action you really had feelings about the other characters than John. Caine's character (Donnie Yen) was tremendous at his job. He made himself a believable blind men without making his character such as Daredevil. When you first saw you him you instantly hated him but with the movie progressing you started to like him. Marquis (Bill Skasgard) gave you the vibe of a hateful villain from the start and keeping that vibe irritating you through the whole movie. The tracker (Shamier Anderson) was a fun character also being more a anti-hero than a villain giving us memories from the first John Wick with his dog. And the comeback of some iconic characters such as Charon,Winston and King. And in the end a very sad but also nice conclusion with the villain ending up dead Caine and his daughter being saved and John finally resting joining his wife in the afterlife and making himself the name of the most notorious person in the underworld.

Basically, in New York City, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is hiding underground with the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) and is preparing to exact revenge against the High Table. He travels to Morocco and kills the Elder (George Georgiou), the \"one who sits above the Table\". In response, New York Continental hotel manager Winston (Ian McShane) and his concierge, Charon (Lance Reddick, posthumously), are summoned by the Marquis Vincent de Gramont (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd), a member of the High Table. De Gramont explains that the High Table has given him unlimited resources to find and kill John Wick. To punish Winston for his failure to assassinate John, De Gramont strips him of his duties as manager, declares him \"excommunicado\", destroys the Continental, and kills Charon. De Gramont then travels to Paris, France and hires blind, retired High Table assassin Caine (Donnie Yen) to kill John, his old friend, threatening to murder Caine's daughter otherwise. John takes refuge at the Osaka Continental, run by his friend Shimazu Koji (Hiroyuki Sanada). De Gramont's right-hand man Chidi (Marko Zaror), backed by High Table assassins and Caine, arrives to investigate the hotel. Shimazu's daughter Akira (Rina Sawayama), the hotel's concierge, evacuates all guests and staff before the High Table \"deconsecrates\" it, igniting a large-scale fight. John fights through numerous armed assassins and ends up in a showdown with Caine. They are interrupted by a bounty hunter who calls himself \"Mr. Nobody\", aka The Tracker (Shamier Anderson). Mr. Nobody changes his mind, determining the contract money for killing John to be insufficient, and helps him to escape. Caine allows a wounded Akira to flee after killing her father. John returns to New York and meets with a vengeful Winston at Charon's gravesite. Winston suggests John should do an old High Table tradition and challenge De Gramont to a duel. Winning would free John of all obligations to the High Table, but he can only request a duel on behalf of a crime family. He travels to the Berlin headquarters of the Ruska Roma crime syndicate, to request readmission after severing ties with them. John's adoptive sister Katia (Natalia Tena) agrees to his request in exchange for John killing High Table member Killa (Scott Adkins) who murdered her father. John is ambushed by many of Killa's men at his nightclub, but John manages to kill all of them; he manages to eliminate Killa and regain his status. Winston relays John's formal challenge to De Gramont. He requests that if John wins the challenge, the New York Continental be rebuilt, with him reinstated as manager. In Paris, John and De Gramont decide the parameters of their duel, in a meeting moderated by the Table's emissary, Harbinger (Clancy Brown). They decide on duelling pistols at sunrise at Sacr\u00e9-Coeur. De Gramont nominates a reluctant Caine to fight in his place. John and Winston will be executed if neither of them appears on time. The Bowery King arrives in Paris to give John a pistol and a new ballistic (bulletproof) suit. De Gramont intends to prevent John from arriving at the duel in time by placing a $26 million bounty on him, with a pirate radio station DJ (Marie Pierra Kakoma) reporting his movements to all assassins in the area. John fights off hordes of assassins a few miles from the Eiffel Tower on his way to Sacr\u00e9-Coeur. Mr. Nobody is there and negotiates the bounty be increased to $40 million. John continues to kill off more assassins inside a dilapidated building and runs into Mr. Nobody. During their confrontation, John prevents Chidi from killing Mr. Nobody's beloved dog. He is stunned and decides to abandon his pursuit of John and subsequently kills Chidi. John reaches a long staircase that leads to Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, where many killers try to stop him from reaching the top. After numerous kills, John does end up tumbling back down to the bottom, but Caine and Mr. Nobody assist him in traversing back up. They reach the summit just in time for the duel. Harbinger conducts the duel, John and Caine take their paces and inflict serious wounds on each other through two rounds of duelling. The third round comes to a halt when Caine mortally wounds John. Demanding the right to administer the coup de gr\u00e2ce (\"blow of mercy\"), De Gramont eagerly swaps places with Caine. However, as he approaches, John reveals he did not fire his third bullet, and shoots and kills an unsuspecting De Gramont. The Harbinger grants Caine and John their freedom from the High Table, and Winston is reinstated. John walks away and collapses on the staircase, reflecting upon his life and being married to his late wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan) before peacefully succumbing to his injuries. Sometime later, Winston and the Bowery King stand at John's gravesite where he is buried beside Helen. In a post-credits scene, Caine returns to Paris to reunite with his daughter but is approached by Akira, who pulls out a weapon, wanting vengeance for her father's death. Also starring Sven Marquardt as Klaus, and Andrej Kaminsky as Priest. Reeves remains cool and focused as the former assassin that will not be messed with, Skarsg\u00e5rd is sinister enough as the villain, Adkins in a fat suit is amusing as a supporting villain, and the support of Brown, McShane, Fishburne, and the late Reddick are welcome. The biggest problems I have with this fourth (and possibly final) outing in the series is that it is too long (3 hours 49 minutes), it is very repetitive (the amount of times John falls from a high height and is able to get up and run!!), and I don't know if there was a completely rounded revenge style story. However, I cannot deny that the fights are well choreographed, the body count and violence is high, and the birds eye view building gunfight sequence, the staircase climb, and the final showdown (all three irritatingly two hours later!) are highlights, it is a worthwhile action thriller.

This world that we have experienced in the last movies has changed so dramatically. Overall heavily disappointed but there was some great action scenes. Also SPOILER:::John wicks death was well done. A little abrupt but it was time."},{"users":"thatchaz","ratings":"3","titles":"Just pretend it ended with Three","reviews":"Oh dear. This was truly awful.

When seeing an action movie you don't anticipate this level of cinematography, visuals, acting, and ultra-stylized set pieces and locals. Let alone the fight choreography, stunts, and effects work. This movie also invents new open lens tracking sequences with a crane that have never been used and many will try and duplicate in the future as it elicits a brand new audience viewpoint and sensory experience. It lacks a bit in structure, and some scenes might be just a little too long, but that's ticky tacky. This movie is pure fun and continues to the raise the bar, shockingly, for not only the John Wick series but also the action genre itself.

The set pieces are fantastic and brilliant, the plot is unpredictable, the cinematography is great, and it is a rare feat that every John Wick sequel is better than its predecessor.The film picks up right where the third film left off, with John Wick on the run from the High Table. He travels to Japan, France, and Berlin, seeking revenge on those who have wronged him.The set pieces in John Wick: Chapter 4 are simply breathtaking. There are multiple extended action sequences that will leave you breathless. The film's director, Chad Stahelski, has a gift for staging and choreographing action scenes, and he pulls out all the stops in this film.The plot of John Wick: Chapter 4 is also very unpredictable. The film is full of twists and turns, and you never know what's going to happen next. This makes the film very exciting to watch.The cinematography in John Wick: Chapter 4 is also very good.

The fact the movie is very long only makes it even better to remember. I was curious how John Wick was going to top off the 3rd film, but the 4th was a massive improvement.

Great directing, acting, pacing, choreography and simple, but effective plot. The lore of the mythical history of the John Wick criminal universe is a well done and told in simplicity to provide enough interest and understanding.Depending on your mood when you watch this, it may seem a tad too long of a movie, but if you are a fan of this genre, there is enough action to keep you happy.Sound track is great and there is a music video and stylistic vibe to the filming. As always in a John Wick movie, in most action scenes, John Wick is almost indestructible and \"lucky\".

Wow ....","reviews":"I have to say that the only John Wick film that I've really liked before this one is the original. The two sequels that followed we're good but 8 wasn't as impressed as I was with the first one. Also, the 3rd one felt to bloated. It was all over the place.So what about John Wick 4? It is no doubt the best since the original. I would say even better. When I saw the long runtime u thought it would be too long and dragged out but what Keanu Reeves and durector Chad Staheski have put together one of the most exciting action movies to come out in a very long time. They went for broke here. As far as story, that has never been the strong suit of this franchise anyway but again John Wick wants his freedom from The High Table and everyone is out to stop him. What makes this film so enjoyable is how comfortable Keanu Reeves is in the role and ll8ndont know how much of the stunt work he actually died but he goes all out here. The fight and gun choreography is on a level that is now the new standard. These days action films are so full 9f CGI that they feel.like animation really. I'm sure that this film has CGI in many spots but there is a great amount of terrific stunt work done here. The action is fast, and somewhat exhausting at times but done in a way that has you glued to the screen!!!Best action film in a long time!!!Grade: A-"},{"users":"rcrdofjrdo","ratings":"5","titles":"No longer a movie with a soul","reviews":"The John Wick franchise has provided memorable action scenes and have propelled the uber-cool and super charismatic Keanu Reeves to new heights. Nevertheless, this movie in some form undoes what previous chapters have painfully built.The story is unnecessarily convoluted and way too long to be entertaining. Motivations come and go, with no real substance rather than to keep the plot running. Most annoyingly perhaps is that action scenes feel somewhat recycled. For instance whatever was cool about animals in chapters 2 and 3 is rehashed here to little innovative effect. Even the actual physical setting: an early scene in the movie takes place in what felt like a too familiar museum-type of place with lots of neon lights and warrior masks and armors behind glass boxes. It's like things that were cool and worked out previously are just brought again. Lots of characters that are important to the plot, appear and disappear without having ever been mentioned before, creating some horrendous plot holes. All in all, it seems that there is so much that is forced and just \"more of the same\" cash-generating formula.All of this would have been overlooked, if the characters were a little more real and less \"Fast and the Furious.\" By this I mean that the action scenes and apparent immortality of certain actors have so much more in common with Vin Diesel and his gang than with earlier John Wick movies. No one important dies easily and there's a point that the logic of how someone can just keep going defies any common sense. Nothing feels at stake since you feel throughout the movie that John Wick will just keep going, not by sheer spirit and determination (as it was before) but rather by super-human abilities that, let's be honest, are just dumb.As an audience member, I felt to some extent disrespected. The action and story in itself is so ilogical that there is no reason anymore to think more about any of these characters. Ian McShane's gravitas is lost. He's just playing the same role, saying the same things, looking cool, but adding so little. Same goes for Morpheus, sorry, Laurence Fishburne, who just do the same he did but somehow now in a different location.All in all, a franchise that ran out of ideas and while beautifully filmed and with some exciting scenes, defies logic in so many ways it is hard to keep yourself interested or invested."},{"users":"mhosseinest","ratings":"10","titles":"REAL ACTION","reviews":"One of the best action movies in history. I really don't know how they made those sequences. The action scenes are very professionally designed. The lighting and sound are excellent. The synchronization of the music and the action sequences is wonderful. The actors are very good. They played amazing, especially the blind killer and Keanu Reeves. The only bad part of the movie was that John Wick was not injured very much, but it can be said that because of the jacket he was wearing, it was made of Kevlar, and Kevlar is stronger than steel at the same weight. And it is a very powerful impactor, and for this reason, John Wick was very little injured when hitting objects and being thrown. And the reason why the enemies do not headshot John Wick is that they are very beginners and it is very difficult and professional to headshot with a simple Colt caliber. And in all war training, they say that the priority is to shoot the body. In the movie, we saw that the bullets hit John's jacket at close range, and he put his jacket in front of the bullet like Zorro. The only problem with the movie was its long time. John Wick's death was very touching and sad. He was just a lonely man in love. My score is 10 for the tribute to Keanu and John."},{"users":"wwwmohamadmaher","ratings":"10","titles":"Mmm...yeah not really ..seriously that was the chapter 4 we had been waiting for from 2019 , this should be the best action movie this year so far","reviews":"Keanu always did what exactly he good in"},{"users":"anon_film_critic","ratings":"10","titles":"Yes, it's that good","reviews":"The best film in the franchise and the most enjoyable theatrical experience I've had in years.

Some of it is lesser than and could've been cut to make this movie a bit more efficient (I love long movies, but only if the length makes sense). I feel like the Osaka scene should've been closer to the end of the movie, it was incredible.Keanu is more tired looking, nowhere near as sharp as JW1, but still incredible, his only competition is himself.JW1 was kind of believable, the action was intense, but I could see a top level assassin pulling it off (mostly), with a handful of luck. This John Wick can only be Neo, because this movie defies any possible logic or reason.Definitely see in theatres, was a great experience, but no sequel has been as good as the original John Wick movie!"},{"users":"MovieWarfare","ratings":"10","titles":"4 entries in and it is still this good!","reviews":"John Wick is one of the best action franchises in modern cinema. When John Wick first came out in 2014, it was one of the most surprising yet most enjoyable experiences I had. What is even more amazing is that the 2 sequels it got were also amazing! We are now on the 4th entry and the question is if it continues to maintain the quality it has so far.Let's get the obvious out of the way, the action scenes are still absolutely amazing! One thing each entry in this franchise continues to do is to make the action bigger and crazier than the last. There are so many incredible actions set pieces with a roughly 30-minute action scene in Osaka with bows and swords, a stunning sequence in Paris with cars and traffic, a Hotline Miami style action sequence with overhead shots, and one of the best action sequences ever involving stairs. I give every single praise to the stunt people who worked on this as they take some very painful falls in this film. This entry is also the best-looking one in the franchise. The set design and cinematography are phenomenal. John Wick killing people has never looked as beautiful as it does here.Keanu continues to be awesome as John Wick by still doing the action choreography at the age of 57. We get to see him fight with nunchucks and shoot goons while driving a car. Ian McShane, Lance Reddick (R. I. P) and Laurence Fishburne return as Winston, Charon and the Bowery King respectively. They're all still great but have a smaller role this time. There are many new supporting characters are great as well. Donnie Yen joins the franchise as Caine, a blind assassin, who is an old friend but now foe. Donnie Yen always gives his A-game and here is no exception with how he does action as a blind character makes him interesting to watch. Hiroyuki Sanada is Koji who is the manager of the Osaka Continental Hotel who is just a badass and cool guy, Rina Sawayama makes her acting debut as Akira and she does a good job in her small role with some good action as well. Shamier Anderson plays an assassin who tracks John Wick and he also does some great action. What they do with his character is interesting but the best thing is that he has a dog which makes him 100% better. Scott Adkins plays Kilia and he does a good job as a minor antagonist. The main antagonist, Marquis Vincent, is played by Bill Skarsgard and he does a great job of being hateable.What Chapter 4 has over Chapters 2 and 3 is more emotional elements to the story. John Wick is deservingly angry after 3 but you also get to see him contemplate more about when this bloodshed will end. You see him question a lot of what he is doing and whether these conflicts that are bringing his friends into are worth it. Additionally, his relationship with Caine (Donnie Yen) adds some weight to the conflict by making close friends fight each other. The stakes in this film feel bigger as well. Some people complain about the 2-hour 45-minute runtime but the pacing never felt bad and the quieter moments are enjoyable too. If I had to give a negative then the only one, I can think of is the post-credit scene which dampens the ending a little bit.Overall, what an outstanding film! It's insane to think that even on its 4th entry, this film continues to be entertaining and somehow still amazing! Director Chad Stahelski has made an extraordinary franchise and shows everyone in Hollywood, how to make an action movie. With the inclusion of a post-credit scene, I wonder if the plan is to make a new cinematic universe which worries me a bit. There are a lot of potential spinoff ideas such as a Caine (Donnie Yen) spinoff or a Tracker spinoff (Shamier Anderson) or a spinoff with the John Wick 3 character Sofia (Halle Berry). Whatever they do, if it is the same quality as the John Wick movies, then I will be first in line to watch."},{"users":"toonyjakes","ratings":"8","titles":"The greatest action film trilogy of the century.","reviews":"John Wick came out of nowhere. You have such a simple plot, yet it continued to amplify exponentially. I'd rate the first 3 films a \"10\" but this one was slightly odd.Don't get me wrong. It has some of the greatest action scenes of all time in it, but there is less action in general when comparing to the previous films. I only had 2 issues with this movie- the first being that the story just seems a little pointless (as if the plot was ever that important anyway.) Secondly it was just more reserved. I understand Keanu has to go through alot of physical strain for these flicks, and that's where I almost felt the same way for him like I do for the \"Jackass\" crew. It's like, you want them to keep going even though you know it potentially may may be as good as it once was. Believe me though, Keanu didn't lose his step at all. I just feel like this was the tamest John Wick.All in all, you have Keanu side by side with some of the greatest martial artist actors of all time, several unforgettable set peices, and a suitable ending.

I admit, I was kind of weary of the John Wick series after John Wick 3 was alright in my opinion. The action scenes were good and impressive as always but it felt a bit off.John Wick 4 somehow tops their already impressive and world class stunts and action scenes from the past movies and shows everyone else in Hollywood how it is done. Pistols? Yep. Shotguns with flaming bullets? Yes. Nunchucks? Hell yes. Even a pencil is used to injure a man in this movie. It has everything.However, is this movie perfect? No. Some of the action scenes go on a little too long, similar to John Wick 3. The scenes are still cool and very enjoyable but a little too much of anything is bad. There was also a few points or even a bunch of points where John should have been badly injured to the point where he should not have been able to move. Example : jumping out a 4-5 story window, landing on a car and getting up 10 seconds later. I thought it was awesome, but even someone as awesome as John Wick isn't just getting up from that.I also would have liked to see some more background on Mr. Nobody and Caine and more of their stories, but that didn't really take away from the film and it was more of a nitpick by me as to why the movie didn't get a 10\/10 from me.John Wick 4 will go down as one of the best action movies of all time and will be the standard going forward.

Though the movie is 2 hours and 49 minutes, John Wick Chapter 4 holds you in your seat from start to end (as usual). Recommendation, use the facilities first and hold it until the movie is over.

The direction and use of lighting in the movie is simply phenomenal, and it takes the movie to another level.There are moments when it seems like the action is over the top, but the movie quickly redeems itself with the next scene. I would highly recommend this series to anyone who loves action movies, as it is an incredible experience from start to finish.The Continental grounds, the 9mm carbon pistol, crest, rules, and the setting in Japan with the sumo fighters were all executed flawlessly. The costumes, logos, music, dogs, cars, bikes, and horses added another layer of excitement to the movie.I particularly enjoyed the dragon fire breath gun, which was just plain fun to watch. Overall, this movie series is a thrilling and exciting ride, and I'm looking forward to Lions Gate releasing more seasons and episodes in the future.

To be honest, at this point, the franchise feels a bit tired.I get that these movies aren't really about the plot, but the extended universe around Wick is what makes them interesting and it's been like that from the start. Take away the shadowy underground world of the assassins, and the first movie is a generic revenge film with great action sequences. Every instalment since then has upped the ante and introduced new stuff to flesh out this world. This movie seems to plateau a bit in that regard.That being said, there is a lot to like in Chapter 4. We're introduced to new - and admittedly fun - characters like Donnie Yen's Caine and Shamier Anderson's \"Hunter - and awesome locations: from Osaka to Berlin to Paris. There are some truly incredible action sequences here: the whole Berlin club scene is - Chef's Kiss - exquisite and highlights the best thing most of these movies do: give us fantastic nightclub fight scenes. The overheard, extended one take in the building, with John shooting incendiary shotgun rounds is absolutely incredible and the best scene of the film, in my opinion. The staircase scene is a great, fun, and truly ludicrous sequence, one that is so unrealistic, you can't help but laugh.However, on the plot side of things, John Wick has never felt more like a video game, with literal mini bosses punctuating the various \"levels\" of the movie. I never really felt emotionally invested, knowing that John can take literally any amount of damage and his plot armour will protect him. It's that lack of tension that was first a feature, and now feels like a bug.Speaking of Mr. Wick, I have to say, Keanu Reeves was pretty bad in this movie. Not in terms of his stunt performance or the physicality, but literally in terms of his acting. I know this is not a popular take, I know he has a certain way of acting in these movies, I'm not dumb. But, I can't help but feel he doesn't really know what tone he's supposed to be hitting with his (very few) lines in this movie.But, he's not the worst actor. That would have to go to Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, whose \"French\" character - Marquis Vincent de Gramont (real name) - has perhaps the worst, most unconvincing, annoying accent I have heard in a LONG TIME. Why they couldn't just hire a French actor is beyond me; Jean Reno should've played this character, we all know it. He's not just an unconvincing villain, but a bafflingly stupid one at that.By the end of Chapter 4, I was exhausted. I like this franchise, but I can't help but feel it probably peaked with 2 and has been on diminishing returns since. The legacy is there, it's good to know when to end."},{"users":"moviemanmo","ratings":"9","titles":"A must see action film","reviews":"John Wick is easily one of the best franchises ever and this movie just adds to how true that is. The use of lights and colors make virtually every scene a picture perfect shot. There's not a single dull moment. Although the fight scenes are amazing, there are scenes where it looks like the attackers are waiting their turn. The use of different weapons is really cool and the main characters all have their weapon of choice.Caine (Donnie Yen) is easily my favorite character in this movie and he steals the show with his action sequences. I can see why people would complain about a blind man fighting like \"Daredevil\" in a world that is supposed to be realistic. But I still enjoyed the action and his character. Overall, everyone in this movie is solid. The character of \"Mr. Nobody\/the tracker\" was the only person I felt could have been improved upon. He was only like-able because he had a dog and his action sequences were the same as what Halle Berry did in the last film.The dialogue is limited but it delivers what it needed to carry the plot. The sprinkle of humor is just the right amount for this type of movie. Although I think John Wick falling down a crazy amount of stairs wasn't meant to be funny but was ridiculously so. As to not spoil the ending, I will say it could have been more dramatic."},{"users":"garethwooduk","ratings":"8","titles":"More action & kills...","reviews":"With every new passing John Wick movie we generally now have an idea what to expect, this movie continues a very similar format like previous but cinematography is spot on, action sequences heightened, set pieces are more vivid and a plot that sees Mr Wick running out of time.Plot was good, a continuation with the stakes heightened and the higher table hell bent on bringing John down with added help at play.Pace of this movie is really good, never lagging and action well balanced with old and new cast playing their part.These movies work because they push the boundaries by upping the anti with glorious visuals with this being inspired by Samurai movies it has a real artistic feel and brilliant in IMAX!"},{"users":"cardsrock","ratings":"10","titles":"A masterpiece of action cinema","reviews":"It's almost unbelievable how this franchise continues to top itself film after film. Just when you think you've seen everything there is to do with action, John Wick: Chapter 4 comes along and flips the entire genre on its head. This is an emotional, propulsive classic that more than justifies its epic runtime.The set pieces are bigger and better than you've ever seen. It's incredible how much innovative action Stahelski can still conjure up. This series continues its rich tradition of exceptional lore and world building. Combined with some truly beautiful imagery and balletic fight scenes, this fourth film is a joy to behold.

S There's a post credit scene!]I can honestly say that Chapter 4 is amazing and might be one of the best movies from this series! The action is really engaging (like the other films), and it looks realistic too, the action scenes take up a lot of the movie but that's just the essence of John Wick and it only adds to the tension and story.Speaking of the story, it's easy to follow and understand, at times it did get emotional but still allowed for some humorous moments that made the audience laugh, and a pretty heart-warming ending. The characters are all very likeable and unlikable (in the sense that you're meant to dislike the character) and the actors played them very well!Other details:"},{"users":"pete-murphy97","ratings":"6","titles":"Parisian Sunrise; John Wick Sunset","reviews":"John Wick Chapter 4 is a nonsensical blast. It's almost three hours of an unbroken chain of jaw-droppingly silly fight scenes that do amount to some entertainment; but fall a fair distance short of coherent storytelling.This is Keanu Reeves indulging in Jackie Chan fight scene fantasies, minus the legendary martial arts extravaganza of Chan. Instead, Wick presents more of a Chuck Norris or Schwarzenegger brute force; he's all bite no bark, letting out the occasional \"Yeah,\" to affirm his next killing spree as a one-man army.And the onslaught really rarely stops for a breather. You could go out for a piss, make a sandwich, do a shopping run and return to quite probably the same fight scene. It's like being waterboarded with the same relentless \"dodge, reload mag, headshot\" sequence.Wick really miraculously dodges a million bullets (a Matrix throwback?), and finds himself fighting, incidentally, in a succession of stunning locations across Paris - where the gendarmerie is nowhere to be seen. But maybe that's a string-pull of The High Table? The film seldom explains itself. Oftentimes, in other areas we see robotic extras as unreactive crowds (nightclub scene). In general, the city doesn't feel like a city, rather a playground for well, John Wick & co. It could be lifted from Grand Theft Auto with how shallow the French metropolis feels here.The Le Chiffre-style crime boss, the \"Marchese\" (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) gives spades of unlikeable sartorial snobbery that's easy to rally against behind the absolute battering ram in John Wick. But the interplay between the characters doesn't amount to much more than grunts, braggadocio, wry smiles, and \"I'm gonna kill you, mate.\"There are other characters too, sidelined by Wick but there on the fringe as sort of cheerleaders. Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), Winston (Ian McShane), and Caine (Donnie Yen) are memorable, but sort of just \"there\".By now, four instalments in, and with lackluster closure, the candle really has burned to the wick. The series shouldn't continue to be the cash cow that it currently is but will probably continue to be.6.2\/10."},{"users":"chef-kyle","ratings":"6","titles":"What happened?","reviews":"For a conclusion to a franchise (at least the Wick story arc) you'd expect story. Each movie has gotten a little further away from telling an interesting story. I even enjoyed when they layered in more of this far-fetched stuff with the high-table & continental in 2 & 3. But, we still don't know much about this world, how it was created, or who is in charge. I thought this movie would do more with this secret government for criminals, but instead this movie made those aspects of the story pointless. So many elements from the past movies were just glazed over to essentially give this movie no story. No Elder, No Winston's betrayal, No past characters except Winston & The King, No Dog, No Wife. All of those things amounted to a few 1-liners in this movie. Instead they focused on the worst aspect of 3 and multiplied it with fights that last too long, and people that need to be shot 20 times.

The storyline is actually good, but there are a few things that don't match expectations. The climax of the fourth film is also a bit unfortunate, it's not as exciting as the climax of the third film (Chapter 3 - Parabellum). There are also several characters whose fate is still unclear. It shouldn't be finished in one film in a hurry, but two films can be made so that it gives a clear conclusion for all the characters. That's just my opinion, anyway.

Rambo got shot in the same shoulder he surivived the doctor survived. Not John Wick hereis the thing about action movie hero they are not supposed to die they are supposed to live. John Wick he died for nothing he dident take down the hightable his friend Donnie Yen probaly going to kill the friend he sacraficed his life for. Johns life is for nothing who did he save the trailers made us think he will take down the high table we could have had endgame moment where thousands of assasins fighting armys of high table forces. They killed of Charon which is bad because his death was for nothing. End of the day we havent even seen who is the true head of the High Table we got another villian like the ajudicator whose roles mean nothing. Not just the terrible ending the action is rushed. One and two the action was more slower and more focused. They are doing these fast shots if they making a pg 13 movie. Donnie Yen is not utilaized he is know for hand to hand not a gun and knife. 5 was supposed to be filmed at the same time as 4 canceled that plan because of covid are you telling me John true bad guy is covid 19. The thing I am worried about is that they will replace Joh n Wick with Ana De Armas or the new girl Akira if thats the case why is everything killing of male charachters with female nobody wants a MSHEU. This can be fixed bring Keanu Reeves back I will give this a 6 out of 10 do not come with the excuses he is old Tom Cruise is older and he going to keep doing stunts until he dies.

Yes, this is getting THAT live-action cartoonish.I loved it, but there hasn't been a bad John Wick movie. In fact, after writing this review, I want to compile a best\/most consistent Action franchises of all-time list. This series will HAVE to be at\/near the top of the greats. Four movies in, four incredible feats.Now, like I said above, this is getting pretty far-fetched. YES, John's survived countless ordeals, shots, hits and of course, heads-up battles with cars in the past 3 movies. Unfortunately, with this outing, they had me almost say, \"enough\" by the time the climax is over.That all said, maybe I was too harsh with comparing this to the horribly over-the-top Fast & Furious films which are so fathomly unrealistic, I hated most of the movies in that series. I couldn't possibly even dislike any of the John Wicks. But...it is getting a little too hard to suspend disbelief.So, John's in a pickle. When has he not been since his dog and car were taken from him in 2014? John must face many bosses before the climax and you can bet he'll be battling much of the almost-three-hour runtime.The more I think about this, the more I like it. It is NOT perfect, and I would certainly rank 1 and 3 higher. Still, you need to see this if you're a fan.As mentioned, this is nearly three hours. Mercifully, it does NOT feel that way. Well, for the most part. I examined a few scenes that dragged out longer than they should have and they were some of the non-action scenes, of course. Everything else: you're just along for the glorious ride of watching John Wick fight countless henchmen to reach his goal.While it doesn't have the depth of 1 or the Halle Berry of 3, it's a worthy chapter in an otherwise fantastic franchise. It's also pretty good looking and has some incredible side characters with complex motives that I absolutely LOVED. In fact, the more the movie went along, the more I loved how they kept the two main side characters fresh for the three acts.I do hope there's a John Wick: Chapter 5, but if it ends here, I'm totally fine. I mean, they kept trying to reboot TV's 24 after it's exciting and conclusive 8 initial seasons and that was a huge mistake.John Wick's rep established in the first one holds up here. SEE THIS!!***Final Thoughts: Here's my ranking:1. John Wick (2014) ~ EASY #12. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum3. John Wick: Chapter 4 ~ barely beating out the 4th spot4.

The second John Wick I found escalated everything that was brilliant about the first one and simply made it all better - better longer fight scenes, better character development and better direction. Then came number three which I was really quite disappointed with. I found the pacing so uncomfortable - there was so much action, so much nonsense on screen that I felt the franchise had lost its way.But today I saw chapter 4 - the best way I can describe it it is that it is a strange mix between chapter 2 and chapter 3 but my god does it work. The action, direction and choreography and stunt work on display here has simply never been seen like this in an action movie before. I think I can confidently say that it is the best of the sequels.Bill sarsgaard is simply magnificent as the new villain, most of the new characters introduced add depth to the world and it seems to me that the series has come full circle to finally find a place where it belongs - larger than life action with sometimes even sincere character moments and a solidly paced story.There are so many fantastic actions sequences here that it is hard to describe how enthralling and how fun they are but rest assured if you are even the slightest fan of action films you will absolutely love John Wick chapter 4.By the way...

WTF?Situations director put John Wick in are situations you won't survive even in a video game, no matter how good you are.Some characters felt like they are just there for representation because it is 2023.

I felt after a stellar start, it was a bit too long and some of the repetition in the fights was a bit wearing. It's interesting about the way movies work, that I too felt this was overlong, and repetitive, but it ends (rather than starts) with such a phenomenal series of action moments that I feel much better about it than I did the last one.With John Wick (Keanu Reeves) touring the world damaging the reputation of \"The Table\", they task The Marquis Vincent De Gramont (Bill Skarsgard) with finally bringing him to heel. Having extracted a terrible revenge on The New York Continental, Gramont blackmails blind assassin, and former friend of Wick, Caine (Donnie Yen) to hunt him down. Now a serious liability to his friends, Winston (Ian McShane) comes forward with a plan to free Wick from his debts once and for all.I think I'd actually go as far as to describe the first two thirds of the movie as being lacklustre. It's only really Donnie Yen's reluctant killer that offers anything that we haven't seen before. Much of those earlier scenes seen Wick killing hordes of heavily shielded enemies, so again, as with the third one, the bullets are more to stun people rather than kill them outright. The Marquis sees Skarsgard, play aristocratic villain, which again the series has done before, though not perhaps with someone struggling as much with the accent as he is.There are some raw moments with Lance Reddick in these early scenes too, who, as ever, was great.The last third though, from the moment he steps out of the subway into Paris and battles across the city is phenomenal. It's a breathless action scene that lasts around 45 minutes, barely pausing for a moments respite. It seems him use cars, motorbikes, and all sorts of the weaponry to fend off assassins sent to stop him reaching a certain destination and it really makes great use of Paris as a character in the action. I must say, the scenes when he uses \"Dragons Fire\" bullets is perhaps the most video game thing I've seen a movie do. All the earlier inertia is blown away by perhaps the best sequence the series has ever done, and I do think that I probably feel warmer about the film because it ends with it's best sequence, whereas Parabellum opened with it.I think I'm happy for the story of John himself to end here. We've got a couple of spin offs that are in development that can keep the world going, but I'd really struggle to think what more they could do."},{"users":"vjspyjwpr","ratings":"2","titles":"Nothing New and Too Repetitive","reviews":"This is by far the worst of the 4 John Vick movies. It doesn't explain much to the viewers about what is going on and why. As in the other Vick movies the hero kills and kills, in many scenes they have so many killers coming at him and shooting that it would seem to be impossible for him not to get shot. He does wear Kevlar suits but Kevlar suits do not cover his whole body and Kevlar generally will not stop bullets from long barreled weapons such as assault rifles which are in use throughout the movie. In a 'shoot 'em up' movie like this the viewer has to suspend belief and just enjoy the action but the writer(s) and director took too many liberties, the movie isn't believable - even with suspended belief. At 2 hrs and 45 minutes, this movie is way too long, to fill that time they included long scenes of killing bad guys and it gets very repetitive and tedious. You should skip this movie, it's not worth 2 hr and 45 minutes of your life."},{"users":"gultusaswat","ratings":"10","titles":"Fulfilled my expectations.","reviews":"In the whole John Wick movie series, this is the best in action I would say .

Barebow, katana, cane-sword, nunchaku, sniper rifle, metallic poker, blaster, dueling pistol, all manipulated in the most enthralling and incredible way, not as disposable tools, but as dopamine-full syringes that inject thrilling signals right down the thalamus. In particular, two combat scenes electrified me (no spoilers don't worry), the first being Caine's \"warmup\": his leisurely demeanor, ingenious gadgets, and breakneck motion swiftly establish a dangerous figure that actually might neutralize John Wick in his own movie. Bringing back memory of the blind monk from Rogue One, Donnie Yen's performance of Caine is exquisite, whether his gait, head movement, or battle style. The second scene that blew me away was John's slaughter in the suite, where a long shot follows the killing machine from above the ceiling through multiple rooms as he effortlessly obliterates his enemies with a freaking dragon's breath shotgun. Despite the ubiquitous usage of long takes to display flawless action designs, this scene tops it all off with inventive cinematography, and I love every bit of the RPG vibe it gives.However, like Black Adam, constant fighting comes at a price, which in this case is shown through the characters, the story, and the plot progression. Mr. Nobody is a slightly redundant character, especially when compared to Caine, with an inconsistent motive and a forgettable presence. In my opinion, the part of this character could be entirely deleted to enrich Caine's connection with his daughter and with John, which would result in a more engaging final showdown - but, having Donnie Yen in this film is a blessing, so not a big complaint. However, the abundance of action sequences does perceptively make the plot simpler, as many of the events are deliberately arranged just to transition into another brawl. In the end, there is a point where the fighting fatigues, and I'm referring to the staircase scene: seeing John neymar his way down those steps he took such a long time to climb disrupts the momentum completely. Lastly, perhaps Keanu is a revered celebrity, but he is probably the worst actor in this movie: robotic line delivery, immutable facial expression, and the hairstyle that confuses John Wick with Neo from Matrix Resurrection.Overall, one of the best action films of the decade, but an average movie in all other aspects."},{"users":"masonfisk","ratings":"7","titles":"OVERKILL OR JUST ENOUGH KILL...?","reviews":"Keanu Reeves comes back for the final chapter in his franchise (don't worry there's a Ana De Armas & Continental spinoffs in the works) currently in theaters. Reeves has reached the end of his journey where he has to regain his claim to a seat at the table (by reinstating his gangster status w\/his own clan) so he can get his past deeds wiped by the head of the organization, played by It's Bill Skarsgard, a French Marquis who has Clancy Brown be his mouthpiece while Reeves' advocate, Ian McShane, just wants his hotel (destroyed by the Marquis in the film's opening gambit) reopened. Reeves now has to globetrot around the world to reach France where a final duel (w\/pistols) will take place but not before a legion of assassins, led by a blind Donnie Yen & a dog owning Shamier Anderson, get to him first. Clocking in at a punishing 3 hours (yes I did nod off for a bit) for no apparent reason but to flex ideas the writers\/directors came up w\/in preproduction, the film sometimes is exhaustive fun but other times just exhausting w\/filmic tips of the hat to everything from Lawrence of Arabia to Walter Hill's The Warriors trying to get some clout to a franchise which frankly doesn't need it.

Not only is this one of the best looking action films I've ever seen, it also, for the most part, contains the best action setpieces. Watching this film reminded me most of playing a video game. I'm currently playing the Resident Evil 4 remake, and even though John Wick isn't a horror movie, the action was most reminiscient of a survival horror experience, with Wick constantly scavenging weapons and ammo from fallen enemies. There's no infinite ammo hacks in the Wick series, and that continues.The bigger issue is plot armour, which Wick has in droves. His suit is explained to be made of Kevlar, but no amount of Kevlar justifies the amount of punishment he survives. Also the choreography of one of the minor characters, named Akira, was slightly lacking. She used a bow and arrow and Judo throws, but the enemies she fought were on easy mode compared to Wick's. Don't blame the actress necessarily, she probably just needed a little more practice. Fortunately she was only in one fight scene, and the rest of the action was very fun to watch.My other gripe is the story. Every subsequent Wick film escalates both the action, and the plot contrivances to justify the action. The world of John Wick is one where half the population are assassins, and there are no cops. Seriously, the climax of the film is set in Paris, and there are NO COPS ANYWHERE, while Wick is killing droves of people across four different popular landmarks in peak traffic conditions. There's also an office for the Table (or whatever the assassin org is called) in the Eiffel Tower, where a DJ uses barely coded language to tell all the assassins where Wick is going. It's peak silliness.I'm not gonna dock too many points for this, but I think it is possible to make a movie that has both top tier action and a comprehensible plot with good worldbuilding. Wick has the former and not the latter. We know that there are good action movies with great resonant plots out there. Stuff like Everything Everywhere shows that it is possible. The Matrix still holds up in this regard too (though the action has aged a little) and maybe the future of this franchise will offer better stories as well.In any case, if you want 2 1\/2 hours of fantastic action, John Wick 4 continues to deliver."},{"users":"DarkVulcan29","ratings":"10","titles":"John Wick never ceases to amaze me.","reviews":"The way part 3 left off, fans knew more was coming, and the waited chapter 4 does not disappoint, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is still trying to end him from being hunted and in hopes to finally find peace, by going to the highest power, but getting there won't be easy.Man the action almost never stopes, pretty much there is little time to breath, but that has always been the joy of this series. Keanu Reeves is always at his best here. But everybody here does shine in there own way, even two characters I believe that derserve there own spin off, you'll know them when you see them.

Go watch this in the theater. Incredible. There are a minimum of three action scenes that would stand on their own as a solid action movie. But to have all three in the same movie is incredible. There is a deliberate awareness of itself the previous three movies had also, but not to this effect. The results are some of the funniest laughs I've ever had in a movie theater. I want to go watch it again with different friends to see their reactions to some of the most insane action I have ever seen. I will be buying the 4K Bluray and skipping to the three aforementioned scenes for repeat viewing over and over. My score for John Wick Chapter 4: 10\/10. It is one of the best action movies of all time."},{"users":"Jeremy_Urquhart","ratings":"8","titles":"Yeah, I'm thinking Keanu's back","reviews":"You know you're in good hands when a film begins with Laurence Fishburne being used to explicitly shout out Lawrence of Arabia (I see what you did there, movie).John Wick: Chapter 4 is more John Wick. It is likely exactly what you're expecting it to be, but if you're like me and you had high hopes for this fourth installment, you're likely to be pleased by what the film delivers, even if it doesn't entirely blow expectations away. The title character is once again put up against plenty of people who want him dead. The story is designed in a way to get him to travel to various locales, all of which are well-utilized in the action scenes. And when it comes time for those action scenes themselves, they're largely spectacular.Things manage to escalate even more from the gleefully over-the-top Chapter 3, but I will say, the opening half-hour to 45 minutes of this proves to be surprisingly restrained. The momentum never slows down too much, but to some extent, it takes its time to get all the pieces in place. After that's done, things don't let up much at all, and I was glad to see the non-stop energy and fighting of the third film's opening act replicated here, except this time it plays out during the final act, and in a new location.There were other key details I really liked. One action scene is shot in a way that looks like a live-action version of Hotline Miami, and the results are pretty great. There's also some really good music used throughout, including Justice's Genesis (not the only on-the-nose music choice, given they're a French House duo and the scene it plays during takes place in Paris, but it fits the heightened style of the movie).You do feel the length at some points, and I don't think it's the best-paced recent blockbuster with a three-ish hour-long runtime. Still, it delivers stylish action, a high-stakes, kind of goofy, but engaging and simple story, and Keanu Reeves and a talented supporting cast all doing their thing. The creativity and stuntwork found in the action sequences are great, and it all adds up to what might be the best entry in the whole series (beating out Chapter 3 by a hair for me)."},{"users":"smkashan","ratings":"9","titles":"Perfect ending to the series!","reviews":"Now thats how you make the final chapter. Paced perfectly, shot stunningly and acted beautifully! Builds up on the strengths of John Wick 1 and John Wick 2 and fixes the flaws of John Wick 3. I really hope they keep this as the end of the franchise because the conclusion is just flawless where chapter 4 ties up everything together giving due justice to all its characters. Kudos to the director for coming up with this gem of a movie and the stunt crew for the out of this world stunt scenes and thank you Keanu Reeves for being Keanu Reeves. You have taken gun fighting and close combat action genre to another level!!"},{"users":"prolead","ratings":"10","titles":"A violent ballet","reviews":"There is art in everything and in JW4 it's the ballet of violence. From the get go, the movie unleashes artfully choreographed violence that involves weapons, martial arts and just pure raw hand to hand combat.Ideologically, I am against violence but I saw this as art, a form of expression and when I saw it like that, it just felt like I was watching a dance performance. It just happens to be violence in this case. Keanu reeves is excellent, a little older but smooth and has given a 100% to every scene.The movie runs quickly without wasting too much time on building narrative, most of it is simple, clear and precise. Is it realistic? NO, but you did come to watch JW4 so just enjoy the ride."},{"users":"Pairic","ratings":"8","titles":"Balletic Fight Action","reviews":"John Wick: Chapter 4: These aren;t fights, rather ballets are being played out as John Wick (Keanu Reeves) and his friends fight off legions of attackers. Set piece battles take place in a hotel, a disco and in the traffic next to the Arc de Triomphe. The Triomphe sequence is perhaps the best as Wick has to dodge cars as well as waves of attackers sent out by the Table and attracted by the ever increasing bounty on his head. Wick is even half hanged in a Russian Orthodox Church in Berlin. Family, friendship and the comradeship forged in battle is important here, ties which have weakened must be rebuilt. Caine (Donnie Yen) is a blind assassin and old friend of Wick who is now forced to pursue him, A new bounty hunter, The Tracker (Shamier Anderson) complete with cute German shepherd (dog) is also on his trail. Most fearsome of his foes is the Marquis (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) who dispossesses Winston Scott Ian McShane and destroys his hotel. This is a dark tale, while the sheer number of deaths may appear comedic the means by which they are killed and the graphically displayed aftermath will choke the laughter in your throat. But it's not just an action thriller, there are shades of paranoic conspiracy and existential terror which infuse this film. Some pretty good acting from Reeves, Yen and the ensemble cast. DDrected by Chad Stahelski and written by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch. 8\/10."},{"users":"lgtsnpz","ratings":"10","titles":"The best John Wick movie of all time and one of the best action movies of all time.","reviews":"This is one of the best action movies of all time hands down no competition. This installment blows all of the other movies out of the water with the action scenes and it mixes it perfectly with story telling. I would love to see them take this series forward but if this movie were to be the end of the franchise i would be content. This film has made me want to rewatch all of the other films to really get the full experience of the story as they pick up where each one left off.

Sparse on dialog and heavy (and I mean HEAVY) on action, this movie, if it does nothing else, raises the bar for future action films to a Mount Everest level. It would be absurd in the extreme if it wasn't done so artfully.In an age of CGI cheats and costumed tomfoolery, JW4 is a breath of fresh air. The action, while highly stylized, is tactile. The characters are operatic archetypes who inhabit the constant chaos as if it were normal. Every single aspect of this film shows a total and complete commitment to craft and care. This is no simple money grab or milking a dry teat (I'm looking at you Disney). This is a passion project and the result is a film that earns every single minute of its 169 minute runtime."},{"users":"KOOLAIDBRO","ratings":"10","titles":"Game changer","reviews":"This movie is going to be like Die Hard in how a lot of action movies from here on will copy it in some way.

At times I felt like I was on a roller-coaster or the adrenaline you get playing basketball. I hope they make more because they're so much fun, but if it is the last that's a helluva way to go. Hands down the best action movie I've ever seen.

So says Keanu Reeves and he's definitely back for a 4th time in 2023's John Wick: Chapter 4. This \"wick\", well it still burns brightly even though it might signal the coda end to this immensely popular franchise (hint, hint).Anyway, bearded hitman Wick now has upwards of a $40 million dollar bounty on his head. That's because he offed the Elder of the High Table (oops). Yup, if you've seen the previous John Wick installments, you know what's coming. Reeves gets his kill on with vested suit and a certain level of badassery in tote. \"Whoa\" is he.So yeah, Keanu doesn't say much in \"Chapter 4\" but the screen presence is still off the charts. I mean he'll always be the Canadian Harrison Ford to me. The dude, well he's a physical actor by trade, all bruised and battered and one tough SOB. It's almost laughably implausible that the Wick-meister survives massive falls and two stair tumbling-s. Ouch.Mr. \"Cool Breeze\" aside, the more you watch all the John Wick flicks, the more you realize it's not about revenge anymore. With \"Chapter 4\", you're seeing mainly Japanese cinema at this point, with samurai sword fighting and Kurosawa stuff and all that slice and dice jazz. I mean we're talking birds in flight violence, bone-crunching poetry, and nunchucks (\"don't forget the nunchucks\"). Like cinematic, habanero hot sauce, it just hurts so good.John Wick: Chapter 4's director is Chad Stahelski (duh). He has only done four pics and they're all Wicks. Besides introducing a few new characters (two of which being a sightless assassin and a bloodthirsty canine), Stahelski fashions John Wick as a guy who has to fight because there's nothing else he knows how to do. It's almost fascinating and goofy at the same time. I mean does Wick eat? Doesn't seem like it. Does Wick sleep? Probably not. Does Wick use the bathroom? They might attack him while he's in there. Finally, does Wick take time to read a book or sip hot cocoa at Starbucks? Get real people. \"Chapter 4\" is all about Reeves kicking butt and it has just enough action takes for the fly-by, 169-minute running time. I'll pay $10.50 for that noise."},{"users":"Cylac","ratings":"8","titles":"Love this chapter but..","reviews":"I've watched chapter 1 to 3 several times and I still really enjoy them. This new chapter is good, but not as good as the previous three. It seems like they were trying too hard to add similar battles scenes from the previous films. The locations are amazing (it's amazing how he travels around the word so fast haha). Some of the fighting sequences were a bit too far fetches in my opinion compared to the other films. He's basically in \"god\" mode or all the people trying to kill him are former Storm Troopers. He falls from high balconies, off building, gets hit by several cars and even rolls down over 200 steps.. and still gets up like nothing. That \"suit\" of his must be highly padded to withstand all that abuse. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the film and I'll definitely watch it again.. it's just my least favourite of the 4.. and I love how they ended the film.. leaves it open to potentially more chapters or not."},{"users":"AarushSRK","ratings":"10","titles":"Outstanding \ud83d\udca5","reviews":"The wait was worth it.

It delivered with the great action of a typical John Wick action but also had other compelling story lines and the one liners you would expect. The actions scenes are top notch but they always have an undertone of rules and respect that makes it really enjoyable. The lighting was great and even with endless action they still made you really enjoy the characters. The storyline was simple and straight forward but keeps you engaged through out the whole movie. The ending was unpredictable which i really appreciated and I felt keeps me excited. It was not meant to be repetitive and ruin the franchise. It told a story and stuck to the code of the movie. This movie knows exactly what it is and did it 10 out of 10.

While there is quite a bit of CGI enhancement, it doesn't detract from the live action which feels very fresh and visceral.It's a shame that the JW movies are getting longer, since the extra runtime in subsequent movies has not added any depth or more excitement than the first - more is not necessarily better."},{"users":"anirudhsarma","ratings":"10","titles":"Action choreography","reviews":"Choreography in cinema has long been associated with depiction of story, visual and dance. But for one of the first times this movie has presented a new method of action choreography, this movie will serve as a template of action movies to come for decades.With a steady camera, constant movement, multiple camera angles, repeated use of body posture just as a ballet dance would, the director and choreographer have been able to merge together gun fight, sword play and human body movement into an amazing masterpiece.The movie contains no frills no time wasting no fillers no nonsense, the intermission arrives before you know it. You are on the edge of your seat, begging, asking for more, unknowing of what is to come.The director has used his 20+ years of action direction and experience to culminate into a new genre that has given the much needed action genre a breath of fresh air. Using Karate, taekwondo, gun combat, old school pistol duel, samurai sword duel, god the number of different martial schools used in this 2hrs and 50mins of mind blowing action is a true testament to the directors experience, where he holds no cards to his chest and lays it all on the table.The earlier John Wick movies were themselves a huge yardstick to measure quality and progress, but this one the director and Mr. Reeves has taken it to the next level.

It was good, almost great, but a lot of small issues add up to the movie having larger issues.I don't care what kind of dance club you're in, if you see people being shot, shooting in general, you're not going to continue dancing right next to them, you just aren't.Only after 15 minutes of multi level shooting does anyone even try to run away....Ditto for the cars at the Arc de triumph (sp), yes some cars will for sure just continue on with their night, not those that have had bodies slammed in to them or through the windshields. I'll even concede that no one should want to stick around given the shooting, but it would be swarmed with police rather quicker than 20 minutes.Not specific to this film, but it is overtly noticeable because it is such an action heavy movie, any time there is more than 1 or 2 guys attacking John, there's ALWAYS people noticeably just \"waiting their turn to die\" as per the script.In JW3 it was the Asian guys that gave him a chance to stand up and fight fairly, the second guy was always just sort of waiting or rolling around needlessly. Same thing in this movie.Also, if no one is scared of the cops showing up, you can't tell me that a dozen or more guys haven't been honing their rifle skills to shoot their targets at a distance of more than hugging.Despite the complaints above, it was still a good movie, definitely did not feel like 3 hours, and I'll gladly add it to the movie collection."},{"users":"SPZMaxinema","ratings":"9","titles":"Freaking awesome.

The John Wick franchise and Keanu Reeves literally bring people together and action like this is what we need in our movies, real stunts on camera with real effort and without needless CGI! Donnie Yen killed it in his role and there are fantastic sequences that blew me away (the stairs scene, the Paris traffic scene around the Arc De Triomphe, and the ending duel specifically). The wet night club fight and the fancy Japanese hotel scene were astounding as well, and throw in the humor and the dog as the two cherries on top. Take notes Hollywood!

Saw a review saying John Wick getting shot at so much without getting shot was unrealistic. I mean the whole concept is unrealistic which is why he is the Baba Yaga. Also the bulletproof lining in the suits help.What was unrealistic was the fat guy being able to land a few kicks on John Wick. Now if he was more of a traditional boxer than a kicker, than would make more sense.Donnie Yen really ruled in this. My favorite thing he did in the film was (being blind) he use a barrel of the gun find a man's face so he could hit him. It was pretty sweet what they did with his character.I wish the daughter at the beginning had more of a presence, but in terms of female fighters, preferred her MUCH better than Halle Berry's character in chapter 3.Best part for my enjoyment was the fight in the old building. They did a single shot that panned out and gave a bird's eye view of the fight scene and it was awesome.Sadly, it looks like they may have actually buried John Wick in this one. However, I suspect Baba Yaga is not actually gone. When they were at his grave, John's dog turned and looked off in the distance so I'm wondering if he saw John.One sad part was the concierge being killed given the real life actor had passed away in real life.So not a 10\/10 because of the fat guy being able to land size-able kicks, but all in all EPIC."},{"users":"saptesh786","ratings":"7","titles":"4th installment is below mark","reviews":"Just saw 4th installment of much talked and long time waited with eager and high expectations but I disappointed while watching.

It's like drinking old wine which just tastes better with age and such is the case with John wick series so far, the current one better than the last one.Well this time stakes are all time high with the High table hell bent on finishing John wick off once and for all by any means Necessary. But the thing is this time our Protagonist is not being hunted like his last outing but is hunting his way up the table in his pursuit for freedom and getting closure on his wife.This installment has doubled down on everything be it headcounts, length of the action sequences to the gorgeous Cinematography. The use of different light settings in different world zones of Osaka, Paris, Berling or Newyork is a sight to behold which just ups the ante in every possible way. The use of BGM when any action sequence kicks off simply ignites the adrenaline rush until it keeps you wanting for more in a breathtaking style.Although I noticed one thing that this part does not offer anything inventive in terms of use of anything in combat sequences but still holds great for the sequences to work. I thought to myself what could they possibly show to top the action sequences shown before in the franchisee but they always find a way to surprise you in the best ways possible.Seeing Keanu Reeves doing most of the stunts all by himself and the talent involved in making all this work by Chad Stahelski (who himself has been doing great stunts as a stuntman for the past 2 decades) and it shows in his zeal to achieve the best outcome with lesser reliance on the VFX and more on practical effects and using real life locations instead of using green screen half the time as they (Marvel and DC to name a few) normally do.Well I would sum up by saying that this outing is his best yet and it would be wise for you to watch it on the big screen and not wait for it to come on OTT."},{"users":"jp_91","ratings":"3","titles":"\"John Wick: Chapter 4\" is a weak film!","reviews":"\"John Wick: Chapter 4\" is a film that offers what its trailer promises: action and more action, achieving a product whose production is outstanding, colorful cinematography and risky camera movements, as well as outstanding editing work and a soundtrack well done.

We go to the cinema to be entertained, to be taken out of our mundane day to day life, and strapped into a roller-coaster ride of entertainment and fun.The success of this movie and Top Gun Maverick, combined with the embarrassing failures of Disney, should hopefully see a shift back to traditional film making and storytelling. Green screen be gone! We want a good plot, character building, and to actually care about what happens to these people. If you define a character by their outward identity first, then you've lost the audience already.Now if you've seen the last 3 John Wick movies, you know what to expect. But take that, and dial it up to 11. The fight scenes are amazing, one scene where we get an aerial view is like combining the best action from both movies and video games. I've never seen it so well done, and you'll be gasping at how cool it is.Kudos to Mr Reeves for his ageless virility. Hiroyuki Sanada brings his usual presence and dominates the screen, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd is a good Bond type villian, and Fishburne and McShane bring things up a notch with excellent performances. But Donnie Yen is the star, he steals every scene he is in. His fight scenes are the best ones, and he has some great dialogue as well.

To make a film that is a reference, you must have the grace and charm of the classics, a superlative cast, an impressive production design, music according to the quality of the film, and a story that has no holes. Here everything is given. We find multiple recognizable figures that contribute not only from the physical point of view but also from an acting point of view. I must highlight the always correct Fishburne and McShane and the always nice Clancy Brown; However, the one who steals the film is the enormous Scott Adkins who can finally demonstrate in the big cinema what he is capable of. There are multiple plot lines (some more interesting than others), necessary tragedies for the progress of the plot, exuberant and often implausible physical display, and the magnet of having most of the great international action movie stars before us. The fact that the beauty of the locations impacts is based on the fact that if you want to give class to a film then you have to resort to that visual enjoyment that only places with history can offer. The movie pays homage to Peckimpah, Leone and many others who delivered the best movies for our pleasure.

Some friends of mine went to watch this movie, not even a Instagram story, not even discussing the movie in the end.Oh, and it has a post credits scene, of about 15 seconds.

There is boss fight between two sub-bosses there is so out of character of the character development created for them just before the fight that it spoils the special ending.Endless mob grinding while spamming potions and abilities. If you play any MOBA games you will understand. Magic jacket need magic weapons of +5 or higher to hit (AD&D reference). Only armour thicker than his jacket is his plot armour.Bad plot writing, b grade action movie ending, c grade special ending. Bad directing, bad pacing of mob clearing, bad cinemography. I joked with my friend that they will try pad out the movie with 5 minute scene of people eating or siting. There were 3 definite moments of these of which when they start he couldn't stop laughing looking at me.The actually padding out of a movie that would be at most 1 hour and 40 minutes long was done with the mob grinding scenes. You see John take his cosmos pistol (a gun with endless bullets, Captain Harlock reference) when plot requires him to toss it use his character hot bar skill to obtain another one.There is feeling of risk even when John gets visibly tired, he just hot bars his stamina potion and is good to go.Pros: Donnie Yen total character commitment in center and off frame of his scenes. He has total commitment to playing a blind person and not some blind kung fu master. You will see him in the side frame continuously shooting in the general direction of an enemy he kills because he doesn't know if he went down and is dead or is touching and tapping with his sword the environment as he moves to make sure of his surroundings. He even sometimes looks the wrong in side frame when people are talking because he is not Dare Devil."},{"users":"daisukereds","ratings":"6","titles":"\"A man's ambition should not exceed his worth\"","reviews":"As a project that started as a gig for those underpaid and overworked, and the charming Keanue Reaves.. it would be unwise for anyone to hope for this to fail. Still, I'm quite surprise with the turn-up.This is an Action movie foremost, with great lighting, great locations and excellent camera work. And more importantly, a real desire to entertain and indulge anyone interested in the genre. The choreography and planning must have been an undertaking, and is great for the most part.. as I feel suffers a bit when Keanu is on screen and as a whole! Specially as it gets a bit repetitive and exhausting with it's length, as well as when you start noticing Keanue's age as he deals with waves of 2 stunt-men at a time rather.. clumsily. It simply looks bad when 2 suits come in, and then 2 armored soldiers, and then 2 suits again and again.The movie seems to be tailored for other characters on it's way out, instead. Mr. Nobody has his well deserved moments, Donnie is easily the best actor on screen (with the best action and his ever charming presence).. but who is closely followed by another great Skarsg\u00e5rd performance! With a great villain most recent movies would kill for. And I'm a fan of Sanada-san.Keanue's stunts aside, his dialogue repertoire is also laughable at best. And not just the lines, but his delivery.."},{"users":"Selppin2_","ratings":"10","titles":"Doesn't Get Ant Better Than This","reviews":"It amazes me how each subsequent John Wick film not only expands the world building, which keeps it interesting from a story perspective, but also manages to up the action to unbelievable levels. This entry is no exception. And they've not only upped the action of the previous entries in this franchise, but they've singlehandedly outclassed every other movie in the genre at the same time.Just the three action sets pieces toward the final 90 minutes of the film blow every other film in the genre out of the water.

It is more of the same (and much more) from Keanu Reeves as the titular character. It has Mr. Wick flying all over the world encountering numerous villains who have been set upon him by Marquis de Gramont (played by a deliciously evil Bill Skarsgard). The action set pieces are well done and there are plenty of exotic places to feast your eyes upon like the Osaka Continental and a bizarre Berlin nightclub. Plus, there are ingenious ways for a blind nemesis to fight off attackers. The other actors are fine including the usually reliable Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburn and the late Lance Reddick. And Scott Adkins is perfectly awful as the grossly overweight and terrifying villain \"Killa\". Those are the good points, but here are bad points - the movie is overlong at 165 minutes. Many of the fight scenes are repetitive and add nothing to the story except extend the run time. So, I while I enjoyed the movie, it could have been edited down to about the standard 2 hours without damaging the storyline in the slightest. I think the high rating in IMDB is unjustified at 8.4, and I would rate this one at a 7\/10."},{"users":"movieman6-413-929510","ratings":"7","titles":"The fourth John Wick film contains almost three hours of entertaining action, but has little story.","reviews":"John Wick: Chapter 4 is the fourth film in the John Wick film series. The film is again directed by Chad Stahelski, who also directed the three previous films.The price on John Wick (Keanu Reeves) continues to rise, prompting more and more deadly opponents to take on him. As John faces off against these new enemies, he also tries to regain his freedom at The High Table, but this demands a lot from him and he can trust fewer and fewer people.With this fourth John Wick film, they are going bigger again with more different types of action. For example, this film contains good and different types of action scenes in succession, which they have put together in creative ways. The film can be reminiscent of The Raid action films where you get to see more action than a real story emerges in the film. This is such a fun and entertaining movie for fans of brutal and entertaining action movies. The movie is also set in different places around the world. This way you get to see a beautiful and creative background where the characters compete against each other. Fights take place in an Asian museum, in a dance club and around the Arc de Triomphe.Due to the long running time and the further lack of a real story, this film sometimes comes across as empty in addition to its action scenes. You learn a little more about the fictional world in which the John Wick films take place, but most of the lines in the films are not always easy to understand. In some scenes where two enemies are together, you don't always understand why they don't kill each other immediately, but take on other opponents first.At the age of 58, Keanu Reeves still manages to deliver entertaining and believable action sequences. Even when he takes blows, he often still manages to defeat his enemies. He has also done most of his stunts himself and only uses a stuntman when John Wick is hit by an enemy car, for example.It is also nice to see Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane and Lance Reddick back in their well-known roles from the series. They know how to portray their well-known roles in good and recognizable ways. It's just a pity that Lance Reddick passed away suddenly earlier this month.Of the many newcomers to the John Wick world, enough know how to steal the film in their moments. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd plays more of a somewhat corrupt businessman who tries to arrange everything from behind the scenes to deal with John Wick. Shamier Anderson plays more of a mysterious hunter, who neither John Wick nor you as a viewer are ever sure if he can really be trusted.Hiroyuki Sanada and Donnie Yen bring a more Asian fighting culture to the John Wick world. Both portray different Asian fighting styles and cultures in the film. For example, Hiroyuki Sanada plays a more wise, honorable warrior, who knows how to take out his enemies in clever ways. Donnie Yen plays a blind character again, just like he did in the Star Wars Spin-off film Rogue One. Despite this handicap, he again portrays his character in a believable and dangerous way."},{"users":"tjb2676","ratings":"8","titles":"Well done 4th Installment","reviews":"Well done!

It added tonthe film and helped to expand the Wick Universe. Thank you for introducing Mr. Nobody & his \"Comfort K-9\".

John Wick 4 neatly wraps up and incredible journey I didn't expect to go on. But I'm greatful I did.It's the Die Hard of my generation and it's learned and matured so well. It's a visual spectical and I could watch it again and again. For me its a great start to cinema in 2023.

John Wick accomplishes absolutely nothing aside from getting all of his friends killed in his efforts to get away from the High Table, and all that sacrifice was meaningless in the end. From the way that the characters kept claiming that you can't change your nature, and how nothing meaningful changed in the end, I can only conclude that the pointlessness was the point.Should we try to better ourselves? No, says this movie. Should we try to better the world? No, you can't do that claims this movie.People, this movie claims, are nothing more than idiotic sheep that will just keep doing what they are doing, even as people are being brutally murdered right before their eyes.

Other than the camera work and the great cinematography, nothing new: John wants to finally see himself free from the assassins' org.The fight choreographies are great! I feel, from the first installment to Chapter 4, fights got better and better. There is this one scene from above that is just perfect --- you'll know when you see it.Plot-wise, it's the continuation and might spam into multiple spin-offs. It's the finale, and a great one.Minor complaint that John, as in all installments, but greatly seen at the third one, takes too much abuse and handles it just fine --- he just limps in pain and that's about it.

The plot is pretty simple - John (Reeves) wants to stop being hunted by assassins from the \"High Table\", so sets out to kill the Marquis (Skarsgard, dodgy French accent), with some help from Winston (McShane) & Bowery King (Fishburne) as in previous films. Then there's the ambiguous presence of fellow assassins Caine (Yen, great as always) and Nobody (Anderson, good newcomer) who have solid arcs.It's pretty impressive they've made four of these films in 10 years, when you take covid into account. The film sets the scene a little, then gets right down to business - Wick & his bulletproof suit killing plenty of \"bad guys\". I lost count, but would guess it's over 250 in the entire film, with over 100 to Wick! You pay to see action, and this film certainly delivers. The series now seems to be in a comfortable place with reality suspended - especially the Arc de Triomphe scene. There's a lack of police, the \"magic\" suits, no one shooting Wick in the head for some reason - where he's become a mix of The Punisher (shoots lots & lots of people, revenge in key driver), Wolverine (doesn't seem to ever die, can use a sword) & James Bond (the suit, good at all forms of combat).While long, the pacing is good, with enough breathers to keep it interesting. The whole assassin underworld thing is tenuous at best, but doesn't weigh it down too much. There's plenty of visually stunning shots and great use of colour, a good score and some exceptional fight scenes, including a long aerial shot in an abandoned building. There's plenty of great moments where you either chuckle, groan or cheer."},{"users":"parksmj","ratings":"10","titles":"Terrific","reviews":"Constant action with Mr Reeves in rare form!From start to finish the storyline is true to the John Wick !

That's a sure thing.Note - they used the exact same framework as in the earlier parts - tempo, music, minimal words, dogs, guns, knives, more guns, cars, bikes...but it works, as in each part even though the formula was same, they bought novelty in its execution and the action layout.Just keep in mind that John Wick does not break bones, might well have \"Vibranium\" inside.Rest all is boom, bang and fun!

The sets and cast are amazing, but honestly you can only watch some one do pistol shots for so long till it gets repetitive and boring. I loved one and 2 and re watched them a lot, 3 I only re watched once cause it got tiresome and 4 definitely was way to long and repetitive. Massive fan of the lore wish there was more instead we get almost 3 hours of Keanu beating a dead horse.There is no sense of time in this movie or situational awareness. He just teleports where ever part of the world he needs to be with out injury after falling out of buildings and hit by cars. The people in the world just continue on while people are getting shot and hacked to death in front of them at night clubs or on the streets. People eating on patios as a shootout happens. So much things made this movie so dumb.I hope they don't milk this franchise and make it like the fast and furious franchise where all of a sudden logic goes out the window and they all suddenly have super powers. The blind assassin is such a cool concept maybe in a different time frame, but you're telling me in a world of professional hitmen with guns and explosives a blind guy is the deadliest amongst them. I'm an average joe and I can kill that assassin he not dodging a full clip from an AR 15 and a few grenades...All in all for action it was amazing as long as you go to enjoy and turn of your brain. The lore is awesome, but the rules are just stupid or do not apply to John himself. Ticket torn cant go home gets back home under the high table for doing what... killing one fat guy... Yet his original story is suppose to be epic what he did that night to get out of the underworld bla bla bla.

The cinematography and stunts are pretty good, especially the birds-eye action sequence.I feel as though this has been transformed into a fast and furious movie or Tug Speedman's Scorcher series.Donnie Yen is a fantastic choreographer and to have him blind in this was nonsensical- a jack of all trades blind assassin....Mr. Nobody could have had more potential instead he has a bit of an identity crisis- it all went down the drain when he wimps out to the Marquis, took away his mysterious badass tracker persona.What is the point of Morpheus in this? He has had a build up for a while and has now transformed into Johns suit and gun supplier? More wasted potential.The world building\/lore is still very weak- there is so much interesting potential here instead we are just given one liners and are expected to eat it up. Fillers for the next bang bang scene to see John using his trusty suit jacket collar shield.Clearly, the writers just solely focussed on the action, sure it looks very cool at times but when you show too much of something it takes the magic away. Using the excuse 'this is a john wick movie' is irrelevant, compare this to the first two and think.

It was a nice, simple, tight story with *great* action sequences that worked really well and revitalized a genre in a way we haven't really seen since Die Hard. The sequel was mostly more of the same but because they could smell the money making potential if they managed to turn this into a major franchise they started to layer on some more world-building details and lore. I didn't like it as much as the first movie but it was still good fun. The third movie is where this franchise started to lose me - sure, the action was still great for the most part, but the believability was starting to slip a little and all the lore they kept adding was beginning to feel more than a little absurd. Now, with this fourth movie... I'm really starting to think the writers just love the smell of their own farts. This franchise is so far up it's own... *ahem* posterior - that I don't think they can even see where they're going next. The action sequences are still very well choreographed and look great - but action sequences alone do not a movie make.I would happily rewatch the first John Wick - it was and is a fantastic movie. I have no desire to ever rewatch any of the sequels and am probably done with this franchise at this point."},{"users":"D4V1D2411","ratings":"8","titles":"A good and worthy finale","reviews":"I was starting to get a bit tired from this franchise, despite me loving the third movie, on some rewatches, it felt like the only thing happening were action sequences, and they were still very impressive and memorable, its just that 2 and a half hours of that gets tiring at some point and I was a little afraid the same thing was going to happen here and on some degree it does, the action sequences are still very impressive and epic. But sometimes they last a little more than what they should, but this movie has much more story than its predecessors, now John Wick has more of an objective than just kill whoever tries to kill him, here, he really has a chance to be free again and with the help of other characters who also have better motivations in this one, he plans on getting it. Obviously the best thing of this movie are the fighting scenes, combined with their awesome cinematography, music and choreographys it makes for a great experience. I already talked about some some of them lasting a bit too much but that doesnt affect the film as much as it could have. And in this one, we have a more clear villain, who you hate from the first scene from which he appears, he is bad. Elegant and menacing, he is awesome. The side characters and new ones introduced are also very interesting and entertaining to watch, mainly Cain, who I hope gets a spin off or something. And all the movie is like this, the best quality of action a movie can have but stopping at the right times so it doesnt get tiring enough. And finally I want to say that the finale was the best it could have been for this saga, the tension depsite not being a fight is the greatest Ive ever felt watching these movies, you are genuinly terrified from whats about to happen, and you dont want to watch the outcome but you have to because its where everything gets defined.

He kinda is a step backwards compared to the men who want to kill him. There is no boogyman anymore. He is shooting at men, they are shooting back, but nobody shoots him in the head.The scene in the building from above was amazing. It looked like a John Wick's version of a Franklin mint clue game.John get fired at, besten, thrown out of a building.

Pure Action Escapism. 9\/10."},{"users":"hanschsolo","ratings":"2","titles":"Three Hour Mindless Action","reviews":"While John Wick 4 points with extraordinary beautiful cinematography and some well-made action sequences, it fails apart at two key points when it comes to movies for me.Firstly the plot. What is this even about? Who knows. People care for the action. But why do we then need to watch more than one hour of build-up for the action, you could watch the action without understanding what is going on, you don't need to know why these people fight, there is no conflict, and even if there is, it doesn't matter, because it has no consequences to the plot. The problem is that the plot is only sequenced trough talking, no visual language.That makes the movie feel like a video-game. The action-scenes are the one you interactively play, and the talking scenes are just long cut scenes. This Formula works for many games, but you can skip those cut-scenes. If it's a good game, the gameplay will make your blood rush and you will not care for that dialogue pause. Best example is Hitman, you don't care for the story, you just want to play.What is John Wicks Goal? I as a Viewer, gather nothing from the motivation of revenge, since the first movie the goal is the same, and it doesn't carry the weight of the first one. He does this all because of the last present his woman gave him, because of a dog. And while the film could dive into wicks character and analyze his psyche, and his former relationship to his woman, because she's the reason of this all happening, It rather focuses on an old friendship that now turned into an rivalry. I want to understand this man, and empathize with him, but the movie simply doesn't care about it's character work and the plot.Secondly the Pacing. It takes too long for the action to begin, and when it ends, it again takes take long until it begins again. A Simple process. And if the story is not compelling enough, it's hard to get trough.I feel like people are getting easier to please within every year and call everything a masterpiece. People seem to go crazy for mindless action without any substance. Without any conflict and emotion. It's nothing new. It's nothing we didn't had 20 years ago.Yes, the Action is good filmed. The lighting is great, but what does it really matter? Is an good action flick really what we need more of nowadays. The genre is oversaturated. It has no weight anymore for me. Filmmakers need to try and do something fresh. I do not want to turn of my brain during a movie.After one and an half hour during the movie passed, I asked myself an Important Question during the movie.What was the intention of John Wick 4? It was not a Vision the director wanted to show us, because there is no vision. Most importantly, there are no emotions. Nothing to move the audience with. There is no art behind this. Even if it's well made, this whole movie feel feels like an ad.So now, I know exactly what the intention of John Wick 4 was. It was Money."},{"users":"TreeFiddy53","ratings":"8","titles":"INSANE!!","reviews":"Okay this movie is INSANE. Insane cinematography. Insane lighting. Insane sound-design. And most of all, insane action -the good ol' gun fights, hand-to-hand combats, sword-fights, everything short of tanks and fighter planes. This is everything the previous movies were, but the duration is 2x. That said, you'll still have to give it all the cinematic liberties to enjoy it thoroughly.Keanu Reeves did exactly what you've seen him do before, nothing new, but twice as much. Special mention to Donnie Yen for the role that he was given. Rina Sawayama, Hiroyuki Sanada, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, Scott Adkins, were GOOD additions.There may come a point where, if you're not a John Wick fan but a regular film lover, you MAY feel \"Okay, dude.

Not only have the films created longer, more unique, and brutal action scenes, but they have increasingly developed the John Wick world. The audience showing their love for the unrealistic has propelled the franchise to lean more towards the absurdity, and deepening the John Wick world into that where normality in John Wick 4 is impossible in the real world.Approaching the 4th chapter, you have to accept the rules in the John Wick world, not as faults in the screenplay, but as a necessary characteristic of storytelling that supports the extensive action scenes that we come to expect. John Wick 4's success is measured in how it succeeds with what it wants to fulfill for the audience, which is a stunning visual\/auditory experience mixed with extended fun action scenes. The story between action is more about using characters and their methodology to expand your knowledge of this world. Sure, John has a goal, but it's purposely 3rd nature as it more or less is shaped by others around him.None of the movies have cared much about a deep story. John Wick 4 carries this tradition as well as seeing if it can succeed by moving the goal posts to see how far they can take the action. The lengthy run time flies by, thereby exemplifies how well the film succeeds with the action. It answers the question how could the other movies be topped. Now, how can John Wick 4 be topped?"},{"users":"ashishkamble-44927","ratings":"10","titles":"Action Genre invented for this Movie Only","reviews":"Perfect action movie ever created, This is perfect scenes shot with ever nerve wrecking killing scenes and background music hit it to different level.Blind man has to gain where john has left with nothing to loose, what if john dies you can feel what if he fails and dead, Active action movie for watch.Perfect action movie ever created, This is perfect scenes shot with ever nerve wrecking killing scenes and background music hit it to different level.Blind man has to gain where john has left with nothing to loose, what if john dies you can feel what if he fails and dead, Active action movie for watch."},{"users":"tudorpenescu","ratings":"9","titles":"A High-Octane Thrill Ride","reviews":"The fourth installment of the John Wick franchise delivers yet another adrenaline-fueled thrill ride, proving that the series hasn't lost its touch.

However, one of the noticeable issues this time around is bad cgi at several points of the movie. This is especially noticeable in car chase scenes or when the assassins on John's trail are being hit by vehicles.The music was as fast paced as the action, no complaints there.However, can we all just agree that a fight in a club with multiple people dying isn't going to have people continue to dance around you?"},{"users":"timeblank","ratings":"10","titles":"I Salute You Mr. John Wick!","reviews":"Beautiful cinematic experience, intense action sequences and great characters that made the movie memorable.

I want to say he wanted to retire again, or wanted some exposition, or wanted another photo of his wife, or something. It doesn't really matter, it was just one long fight scene of a movie, like Shoot Em Up but less fun.The fourth one was weak again plot-wise, but that's expected by now. And the motivation was unclear again until the third act, and seems to be wanting to quit killing people by making it abundantly clear that he is just trying not to die by making it as likely as possible he'll die and trying to quit killing people by killing a hundred people...It was fun to watch, but is nothing more than that. An action movie about action movie stuff, with some fig leaf excuse for the action movie to occur."},{"users":"maindraaritomo","ratings":"7","titles":"Fascinating","reviews":"What I like about this franchise ever since is fighting to kill then weapons are used including firearms. Bullets shot in short range is one crazy thing from over million others. Also how action is started very soon when the movie is on. People killing each other, rumble, brawl, combat in the middle of civilization. But, I wish, director speeds up the fight just a lil bit. I almost sense of Keanu moves the way Liam Neeson did in Taken. Indeed Keanu, Hiroyuki and Donnie are not young anymore. I believe the thrill would move audience more if kicks and punches thrown faster.Am a big fan of Scott Adkins and so remarkable he is a chubby evil villain here. Good choice. Bet audience who doesn't know him would be wowed, the big butt antagonist does spin kick.I also find few trade marks of past movies from actors brought back, Donnie for swinging fist.Last but not least, such films are getting away from reality, too bad, bullet proof suits, rolling falling down on 200 steps without injuries, well, better if such scenario is re-looked if the franchise goes on.Thank you."},{"users":"sikandar-92597","ratings":"6","titles":"A video game version","reviews":"Although it's a decent movie but far from a reality that a man in his 40 can have so much stemina to fight almost every single man on his way to freedom.

Apart from him no one was capable to shoot accurately the whole time like a bollywood movie. Hand to hand fighting scenes are repeated. After leaving the theater I didn't feel anything for the movie.

Afterward we all thought this movie was horrible. One thought it was a comedy, because of the way the killings happen. I felt the assassins trying to kill Wick could have been soccer moms with no fighting experience, it was that off at how they could miss shooting a guy standing next to him.

The fight scenes, especially the duration of the fight scenes, are just so impressive. The story is great and keeps you engaged despite the longer run time.

As has been highly-anticipated, our favorite dog-loving, retired hitman is back in action this weekend. Yes, John Wick resumes his quest to be free from the tyranny of the High Table and all of its bureaucratic, bloody nonsense while continuing to grieve the deaths of his beloved wife and his adorable pup from Chapter 1. These John Wick movies usually have great fight sequences, good visuals and pulsing soundtracks - that's why we keep coming back, so let's see whether Chapter 4 delivers.Do I really need to explain the plot of John Wick: Chapter 4? It is very much a continuation of what has come before. Keanu Reeves returns as assassin-extraordinaire, John Wick. Wick runs afoul to the High Table once again, which puts him back on their radar. The High Table holds Winston (Ian McShane) accountable for John Wick's actions and puts another bounty on Wick's head. John Wick goes from location to location and from elaborate action sequence to even more elaborate action sequence for more than 2 and a half hours to avoid death and gain freedom. Gun-toting hijinks ensue.First, John Wick: Chapter 4 is too long. There is no reason for this movie to be almost 3 hours long. The plot is not that intricate. In fact, it is basically the same as all of the other movies, except the first one, which was really driven by the grief and revenge of the John Wick. Two hours definitely would have gotten the job done. Even though the action sequences are entertaining, they can get overlong and become very exhausting. I can't imagine being Keanu running from place to place, fighting, shooting and falling all over the place. Bless his heart. No wonder he sounds so out of breath.What you really came to John Wick: Chapter 4 for is what it delivers in spades: exquisitely elaborate action set pieces. The movie takes place all over the world, and each location looks beautiful and interesting. There is such ornate and complicated set design, and you know it's especially fragile so it can get destroyed with all of the shooting and fighting. And, these sets do, indeed, get destroyed. There a multiple shoot outs that take 20 minutes, or more, each. It can get fatiguing because once you've seen one shoot out then you've seen them all, but John Wick: Chapter 4 shows that not all elaborate shoot outs are alike. Thankfully, this movie has a good sense of humor as well.Ultimately, John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers the action, dry humor, beautiful shots and elaborate set pieces that we have come to expect from this franchise. Keanu Reeves shows up and puts himself through it. While the story is basically the same as all of the other John Wick movies, it is still as entertaining as ever with clever stunts and even some good musical moments. I'd say it's totally worth a trip to theater with a big box of popcorn."},{"users":"juliavu-57190","ratings":"10","titles":"Just Awesome!","reviews":"The only criticism is that it's not gory enough.This was an amazing movie.

Those roots show throughout.The images are decadent with colour but not subtle. The story and dialogue is workmanlike and efficient.The action peaks in an epic sequence that is part Taxi Driver's overhead shot after the massacre, part hi-res FPS video game 3rd person replay, and it touches on genius.Each of these movies has expanded the \"Wick world\" so to speak, and in doing so Wick hasn't had an opportunity to reflect. It's been run and gun since day one, son.Should there be another chapter, and I suspect there will be, here's hoping they slowly strip back the layers of decadence and allow us a moment of peace and happiness.But let us earn that tranquility with one final run.

Rips off the warriors classic with a stupid black American radio host (in the middle of Paris) \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude02. Extremely poor writing.Very very poor film. Reeves could dodge bullets in the matrix, then stop them. No need for that here, as every bullet no matter how many or how close seem to miss. I would have thought a crossover with marvel might be on the cards. Considering every person seems to have Vibranium weaved into their suits. \ud83d\ude48Class fight choreography, props to the stunt team. Except for the occasional henchman who stands there watching Wick kill his colleagues before lifting his gun after 5 seconds, perfect timing for a John wick reversal. Or a kick that somehow causes Wick to fall down 3 flights of stairs. Keane Reeves definitely has a career as a pro football player, the amount of rolling he does down those steps. Got a few laughs out of the crowd. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02You honestly do have to be quite simple to be impressed by a movie of this quality.

And that table scene with the cards was very intense feel with our three main character and the movie whole had the best action scene throughout the series it's up their with John Wick Chaper 1 maybe higher.Possibly one of the best action movie out there and the best series out there I don't think action are going to be ever the same after this which is a good thing. Caine is my new favorite character his chemistry with John was amazing to see and it really felt like they had a lot of history and It made me really cared for him even though he was try to kill John Wick, his fight scenes were the most interest It suck we won't get a John Wick 5 sequel but please give Caine a sequel he can carry the series on his shoulder easily (just realized there a end credit scene). I wish they showed John Wick abit more before he died.Which makes me wonder if he's really died, I think he's alive living in hiding so the agreement with the high table doesn't make them look weak or was a way for John to get out of this business and part of the agreement.

But the casting was real bad with a little guy like the clown from \"It\" being the main bad guy. Was anyone scared of this guy? Do you look at him and be terrified to face him in a gunfight? Nope! Plus...was he really THAT bad? All he was doing was enforcing the rules of the Table and the hitman organization. Winston let Wick escape in the previous film, and had to accept his punishment. Wick had broken the rules too, and the hunt for him was justified. It's not like Pennywise was after Wick and Winston for fun...no, he was just following the rules. Also, for future villains, if you are going to choose someone to fight on your behalf, don't pick a blind man. I give this a 10 for the action and for Winston and Wick's scenes, but it only gets a 6 because the \"bad guy\" wasn't bad at all.

Normally sequels get worse with each entry, but this franchise has been able to buck that trend. If anything, this entry is the best of the franchise so far.There are two fight sequences that absolutely blew my mind and have stuck with me long after the credits rolled.I've always found John's character and acting stoic, but it fits the character they are trying to write. He's supposed to be a man of few words - his actions speak for him, but I kind of miss the expressiveness Keanu got to portray in the first John Wick movie. Nonetheless, the choreography, music, and action are god tier.I was impressed by the performances of the whole cast, especially Donny Yen. There are a lot of good quotes throughout the movie, one about friendship that I've taken to heart (\"friendship means little if it's only convenient\").

It looked back at JW 1-3 and what made this franchise great, took the absolute best and made it even better.The stunt choreography and coordination was always a highlight in John Wick movies, but this movie was able to build an astonishing almost frightening good momentum. \"Momentum\" not only for the stuns themselves but also for the viewers. Momentum and flow is what made this movie truly great.The cinematography was my personal highlight. Not only was is it able to pick up and greatly reinforce the momentum of the stunt choreography, you could clearly see that every shot and every scene had its own personality and felt unique. With sometimes completely bold and unusual but extremely refreshing perspectives and memorable scenes you would not have expected or even thought of. You could describe whole scenes not by their stunt choreography but by the genius camera angles, cuts, snaps and so on.This movie sets a really high bar not only for the franchise itself but for all other movies coming this year.

It had been a while since I was so engrossed watching a movie in theaters. That's what I thought to myself walking out of the cinema hall after watching this. Of course Avatar was beautiful and had some great visual effects but it didn't have me at the edge of my seat. John Wick: Chapter 4 really turned out to be a great sequel amidst all of us wondering if they were stretching the franchise too much.This movie purely stands out from its predecessors and also from most of the action movies these days because of its 'execution' (see what I did there ;-)). The story isn't anything really out of the box and it is yet again John Wick running away (and killing away) from the lot trying to kill him including the high table. The screenplay is very engaging and it almost acts like going through different levels of a game before meeting the final boss. The action set pieces are very well executed just like many other John Wick movies, but in this film the attention to detail to some of the action is at a different level. I ended up laughing at some of the action sequences just because how outrageous they were and in a good way. My brain was just unable to comprehend that level of awesomeness. The fight scene in a Berlin nightclub is probably one of the best action sequences in a movie and the background score makes it special. The action sequence around Arc De Triomphe is ridiculously good and makes you feel like you are in a fantasy ride. The cinematography is outstanding and offers some very creative perspectives in some scenes, which are worth the big screen experience. Background score and music selection is near perfect and as mentioned this film checks pretty much all the boxes in the technical departments. Another big highlight of the movie is the choice of beautiful locations. The filmmakers have made sure to give a new experience despite choosing many of the mainstream action movie locations.There isn't much that does not work for the movie. The script isn't very new and I personally feel that some parts of the plot weren't really justifying what happened next. Sometimes, the action sequences may feel a bit too streched but that is mainly dependent on an individual's taste.Donnie Yen's characterization as Caine might feel inconsistent at times related to his abilities. It also reminds you of Chirut Imwe from Rogue one but the chemistry between him and John Wick works out for better eventually. While Bill Skarsgard's character is intentionally obnoxious and irritating, it doesn't really create any kind of a significant threat. The antagonist and supporting roles are very well written and never get overshadowed by John Wick. Clancy Brown as Harbinger in a small role is very impactful and Marko Zaror as Chidi, the right hand man of the main antagonist is immense. Scott Adkins as a heavily prosthetic Killa offers a unique comic relief but also a unique resistance to John Wick. Hiroyuki Sanada is his usual best even in a small role and Rina Sawayama as Akira is definitely a future star in the making. Old timers and franchise veterans Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne are pleasant as always. And the main man himself, Keanu Reeves, offers great depth to the character and delivers as many punches as he can but very few lines ;-)"},{"users":"inforlonghaul","ratings":"4","titles":"Action, yes...story, no.","reviews":"I've enjoyed all of the John Wick movies, especially the first one. After seeing the reviews calling this one of the best action movies and maybe even the best John Wick movie, I went into the theater yesterday looking to be blown away. And the theater was packed.Unfortunately, I tried to like this one, but I just can't. I enjoy action movies just as much as many of us but John Wick 4 went to the extreme and made it long, boring, and flatly unenjoyable.John Wick 4 has a nearly three hour runtime, but two hours of it is nothing but him fighting and shooting people and there's about 30 minutes of actual dialogue progressing the storyline and about 15 minutes of filler\/B roll shots.A total two hour run time with the action scenes cut in half would have made for a far more enjoyable movie. The old saying \"too much of a good thing is a bad thing\" holds true for this movie.I rewatched the first John Wick when I got home from the theater yesterday and it clearly showed to me how much John Wick 4 had strayed from the first one.Many of you may enjoy John Wick 4, but unfortunately experience was not."},{"users":"vishuarora-20785","ratings":"10","titles":"BABA YAGA ON TOP","reviews":"Keanu reeves once again proved that he is the one the only greatest action star of this era and amazingly made this franchise is one of the greatest and without our baba yaga , it will always be Incomplete.I want to praise the director and every one behind this epic masterpiece.Great screenplay, Vfx are the main highlight of this movie besides Keanu's every action and fight scene, Best music and background score people who made it more amazing by matching the music and adding vibes to it, all the scenes of the movie were so beautiful whether It was snow scenes when Mr. Wick goes to meet Winston or The Duel Challenge meeting with Marquis & What great ending scenic view of sunsets... what beauty man!John wick is not dead, that is for sure.. it is not easy to kill the perfect baba yaga for anyone.

At least for me. In my opinion, this series is pretty safe. He can do action scenes and that's the main thing for me and I was entertained the whole movie. Add to the fighting and shooting a hilarious soundtrack and the fun was taken care of. I've heard a bit of criticism about the length, but I was fine with it. I wasn't bored for a moment. I also praise the surprise ending. I thought the fourth episode was very good. But after some thought, I'm still leaning towards the third one, which charmed me with its action a bit more than here. The locations were also great and I liked them a lot, but I will mention the third part again, which appealed to me more with its setting. I don't have much to add. John Wick is a luxury action series for me and probably always will be. The action is the main thing here for me and it succeeded this time and once again I praise the surprise ending.

The film's runtime is nearly three hours, and it does not disappoint when it comes to action. The movie commences with John Wick embarking on a battle against a group of assassins pursuing him. John Wick's combat skills are honed, and he quickly dispatches his opponents. The High Table, a group of powerful individuals, appears, and their leader declares that John must die. Caine, a former colleague of John's, is recruited to assist in John's assassination. John must use all his abilities to stay alive, but the odds are against him.The action scenes in the film are spectacular, with some of the most excellent stunt work seen in a long time. There is plenty to see for those who appreciate gunplay and hand-to-hand combat. The stunts are impressive, and the choreography is immaculate. The action in this film is so captivating that viewers will be on the edge of their seats for the entire movie. The scenes come thick and fast and are continually building up to a climax that is nothing short of unforgettable. The actors deliver outstanding performances and excel at bringing their characters to life. Although the storyline is satisfactory, the film's final moments are particularly noteworthy.The movie felt a tad too lengthy and stagnant in certain places. Some of the fight scenes feel repetitive and are repeated several times throughout the movie. Nevertheless, John Wick's fans will undoubtedly appreciate this film.

Constantly repeated scenes and a sense of belonging that can't get the audience into the story in any way. One of the most mediocre films not only in the series, but also for the action genre.There's no franchise more scrappy and likable than the John Wick movies of the last decade. The first film, 2014's John Wick, was a low-budget affair, helmed by an unproven director, stuntman Chad Stahelski, and starring a then-unbankable Keanu Reeves. The movie did OK in theaters but found a more appreciative fanbase on home video."},{"users":"vishnu_valsalan","ratings":"8","titles":"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) critical review","reviews":"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) critical reviewJohn Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) is the latest and possibly the best entry in the action franchise that stars Keanu Reeves as a legendary assassin who defies a powerful criminal organization known as The High Table. The film delivers on its promise of epic wall-to-wall action, with stunning choreography, inventive set pieces, and brutal violence. But it also offers more than just mindless spectacle, as it explores John Wick's personal journey, his motivations, and his connections with other characters.The film picks up where John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum (2019) left off, with John being betrayed by Winston (Ian McShane), the manager of The Continental hotel in New York, and thrown off a building. John survives with the help of his old friend Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), who leads a network of underground informants. Together, they decide to wage war against The High Table and its enforcer, The Marquis (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd), a ruthless and cunning adversary who will stop at nothing to eliminate John Wick.John travels across the globe to seek allies and resources for his fight, from Berlin to Paris to Tokyo. Along the way, he encounters familiar faces such as Charon (Lance Reddick), Winston's loyal concierge; Sofia (Halle Berry), a former colleague who owes him a favor; and Zero (Mark Dacascos), a former rival who respects him. He also meets new allies such as Doc Q (Donnie Yen), an old friend from his past; Kazuya (Hiroyuki Sanada), a Japanese crime lord who has a history with John; and Akane (Rina Sawayama), Kazuya's daughter and prot\u00e9g\u00e9.The film is directed by Chad Stahelski, who has helmed all four John Wick films so far. He brings his expertise in stunt coordination and martial arts to create some of the most impressive action sequences ever seen on screen. The film features a variety of styles and weapons, from hand-to-hand combat to gunfights to sword fights to car chases. The film also pays homage to classic action films such as The Matrix trilogy (which also starred Reeves and Fishburne) and Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2.The film is not without its flaws, however. Some may find the plot too thin or convoluted, or the dialogue too cheesy or exposition-heavy. Some may also find the violence too excessive or gratuitous, or the tone too dark or grim. The film also runs for almost three hours, which may test some viewers' patience or attention span.Nevertheless, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to one of the most successful action franchises of all time. It showcases Keanu Reeves' charisma and commitment as an actor and an action star. It also expands on the rich mythology and world-building of the John Wick universe. It is a must-watch for fans of action cinema and for anyone who enjoys watching Keanu Reeves kick ass."},{"users":"ajuskoto","ratings":"9","titles":"What Makes John Wick 4 A Flood of Praise?","reviews":"I still remember exactly the atmosphere in the cinema lobby when I wanted to go to the cinema in 2014. At that time, I had no plans at all what film to watch, so I finally decided to watch John Wick after seeing Keanu starring in him, I'm a huge fan of the Matrix. Also, I don't know what the film is about, what genre it is.After dozens of minutes of watching, I was dumbfounded. John Wick's character is very unique as an assassin -melancholy, his heart is soft so he can cry sadly, his nature is serious and quiet but sadistic and cold-blooded - and his gun-fu action is very cool. Of the hundreds of films I've watched since I was a child, none of the martial arts action films are as good as this one.A month ago, I purposely re-watched JW123 before watching JW4 last night which I've been waiting for since last year, to refresh my memory so it's more connected with the storyline. The result? Very satisfactory. JW4 is better than all three. Better in terms of selecting new supporting actors, cinematography, storyline, action choreography and in terms of Keanu's acting.1. Brilliant selection of new characters.Of the several new supporting actors, Donnie Yen brilliantly managed to play a very significant role in building the story of JW4. His acting is flexible, his appearance is cool, his action is cool, and his refreshing sense of humor helps reduce tension while watching this film, which is about 80% filled with gun-fu scenes. Previously I was a little disappointed with the selection of Mark Dacascos in JW3.2. Beautiful cinematography.If you pay close attention, there are a number of things related to cinematography that are relatively different from the previous three series. Starting from the sound system, lighting techniques, color themes and shooting angles. There are a number of scenes that remind me of the Matrix trilogy, including fights under a fountain that looks like rain and a scene at a train station. And the most special, the angle of shooting a la bird view in a fight scene.3. The storyline is more natural with a perfect ending.The outline of the story is about John Wick's efforts to free himself from the pressure of The High Table caused by his own actions, breaking the rules by killing Santino D'Antonio in The Continental of New York hotel. At first he had thought of killing all members of The High Table, but his close friends opposed the idea. The ending of the story is perfect, but it's better if I don't tell.4. Better duration, level and beauty of gun-fu action.The duration of the film is almost three hours. In some scenes, I almost felt bored, but the director cleverly stopped it and moved on to another scene at the right time. The fight choreography feels more beautiful and seems natural.5. Acting Keanu Reeves.In several scenes, John Wick's expressions and body gestures are clearly seen to be exhausted, moreover his opponents are really tougher. On his face were lines that showed he was on the verge of despair. This acting is the main part that makes the ending of the story perfect.After watching JW4, regardless of whether there was an intentional element of the story writer and director, it's as if JW123 was deliberately made only to form the perfection of the JW4 film. So, it is only fitting that JW4 will be flooded with praise from film critics such as IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. Most likely this film will become the Top Box Office."},{"users":"gypsy-87293","ratings":"10","titles":"Easily the best so far","reviews":"I gave this film 10\/10 and it earned every single star. Shot in NYC, Jordan, Japan, and Paris, the film captured the beauty and timelessness of each nations' historical locations. The cinematography is the best I have seen in years. The plot emerges and presents an out for John that will release him from his life on the run. Two hours and forty five minutes later, an ending that brought tears to my eyes, including the post credits scene. There is NO WAY our guy is dead, God help me, there better be another John Wick film or we will riot.The only downside of the film is Reeves' acting. They are smart to give him a small amount of dialogue, anything beyond those few words is comical. But I, as I'm sure many others, forgive him. John is a man of few words, therefore Keanu was perfect for the role. He has always been the rare A lister that acts his heart out with minimal dialogue, and somehow pulls it off. Let that be a lesson to you kids, if you have charisma but sound like a teenage stoner, you too can succeed."},{"users":"MiloSuperSpesh","ratings":"8","titles":"Amazing but something is missing and mistakes were made.

Frustrated.","reviews":"I a huge JW fan, and after waiting 4 years for this installment, was expecting something epic. The fighting, gun\/sword lay was indeed epic. I mean, amazing.The story? Lackluster and completely underwhelming.After the way 3 ended, there were so many possibilities for an amazing plot and epic conclusion. When I read that it was near close to a three hour run time, that's exactly what I was expecting!Instead, they introduce a NEW, singular, villain -from seemingly nowhere; Two NEW old friends of John; and a NEW random assassin who has a pet\/partner German shepherd assassin. This last one had to be a ploy to incorporate more of the action sequences from chapter 3. Bc the character was utterly useless for moving the plot, and bc of the screen time allotted to him, annoying.My frustration is that at what could very well be the end, they're introducing all these features, but they haven't done anything with previous features. In fact, there are some that are major loose ends. The adjudicator from 3, Cassius from chapter 2, Aurelio from chapters 1&2, the head of Ruska Roma from ch.3 (the closest John has to a mother\/family), and John Wicks own Pit bull .... None of these characters get even mentioned. I get scheduling conflicts, but 1 scene or even just a reference can go a long way for encapsulating a world or resolving a relationship in a pleasant way that makes an end sweeter.This is some of the best action you're gonna see, but the writers have done nothing to bring this story arch home. We deserved better. And even if there is a fifth, based off the way they ditch character arch's, and seem allergic to FALLING action, I have little faith it will be satisfactory.The plane doesn't land.

Hell, it's just one of the best action sequels ever!","reviews":"John Wick is a funny franchise, and its origin is pretty funny too. People underestimated the first John Wick movie when it released in 2014. It just looked like another throwaway action movie with Keanu Reeves in it, but Keanu Reeves has an appeal all on his own. He has been criticized for his level of acting skill for as long he has been in the industry for since the late 80s, but he certainly isn't a terrible actor. Sure, his emotional range might not be the best of the best, but he still manages to give fine performances none the less. I thought he was pretty damn good in Speed as a passionate cop who just wanted to help people, and his anxiety outburst in The Matrix when he learns the truth was memorable as well. Anyway, people underestimated John Wick 1 and because of that, it seemed to exceed everyone's expectations as a well-directed action\/revenge flick and also showcased a deeper side of Keanu's acting ability.Anyway, after the success of the first film, it was obvious that a sequel would follow, and that's exactly what happened, and then a couple of years later there was a third one and suddenly it became a trilogy! The two following movies changed tone a little bit and became more avant-garde than the original, but these two movies improved on the action and took it to new levels.Now that the fourth chapter is out, it once again brings the quality of action to new heights and now brings it closer to perfection than it ever has before. The action in this film is insanely well shot and directed and is extremely aesthetically pleasing and satisfying. The several action sequences are very lengthy too, with a couple going for over 10 minutes. The last time I saw an action sequence go for this long was in Mad Max: Fury Road almost 8 years ago, and it's pretty obvious that they took a lot of research from that film and how it was crafted. But here's a hot take, I think John Wick 4 is even better! Because unlike Fury Road, it has a story and characters that are on the same level as the action!Every character in this movie is extremely rootable and has their own weaknesses and limitations, there is a blind character in this movie who is an extremely good fighter... but he's still blind and uses sound emitting sensors that he sticks to the walls, so he knows exactly where his enemies are in space, and I thought that was a very nice touch. John Wick himself is also very skilled at hand-to-hand fighting and shooting, but he also isn't a perfect fighting god and will be outsmarted sometimes. The Yakuza leader who ran the hotel in Osaka was great too, and his character was also built in the same way where he had his own strengths and weaknesses.The characters are also very compelling and is clearly shown what each one is struggling with and also showing just how broken as a man Wick is at this point. A certain character changes sides but I won't spoil who. Also, the villain was also pretty good as well. He didn't really have that much of an understandable motivation; he was just ruthless and nasty and that's all he really needed to be. You don't need to explain an antagonist all the time, sometimes they can just be evil for the sake of being evil and that's fine and can also work as being entertaining. He was an intimidating presence, unlike Agent Smith in Matrix Resurrections which was a joke compared to Hugo Weaving.Anyway, I was completely blown away by just how good the action was in this and just how long it went on for without becoming boring. It might just be one of my new all-time Action Favorites and highly recommend that you go see this on the big screen with the best sound. It really was a masterpiece of action with a great story to back it up!"},{"users":"M0n0_bogdan","ratings":"9","titles":"John Wick 4","reviews":"Of course I had fun.

While the JW4 trailer do showcase the level of action you're about to see, but some of the best action scenes are not in the trailer, so you have a lot to discover as you go on a ride with John Wick on his quest to challenge the High Table.While most people are talking about the insane level of action, let me tell you the two other factors that made this movie a cinematic treat to watch.Lighting - Most of the movie scenes are shot at night and they are done beautifully. The neon lights contrast with the dark sky and ultra-black suits and guns and pistols and armours. It creates a new dimension of its own.Camera Work - The cinematography by Dan Laustsen is so immersive. Just after the Paris car scene is over and when John enters a building, pay attention to how the camera moves from the moment John is on the stairs. That scene alone with a spectacular one long-shot camera work is gonna blow you apart.Watch John Wick 4 in IMAX for the best experience."},{"users":"hydralien-40230","ratings":"6","titles":"Less exciting","reviews":"On the positive side, cinematography is great, it is fast-paced and all the scenes and angles look gripping and impressive. Additionally, they really either shot most of it in Paris or made up a pretty convincing CGI version of it, so also looks authentic. Core actors are still doing great job portraying their characters, and some additional roles are also quite solid. Almost-3-hours runtime might be a bit much, but not too bad overall as it balances the story development with action scenes fairly well.On the less positive, the fights are a lot less inventive than in previous installments - it's mostly \"shoot them in the head\" and that's about it. No killing people with a horse or a book or a carrot. Wait no the carrot is from another movie. Still sad though. The traffic scene around Arc de Triomphe was a nice exception, but even that was fairly monotonous. What makes it palatable is the fights are mixed with story development, but the fight themselves are quite boring.Additionally, some characters are either not explained at all (and neither is their motivation) like Nobody, or disappear and leave the story lines dangling (like Akira), or just annoying and pathetic (like Marquis), which makes the whole story feel a lot less solid and definitive comparing to the previous installments (or at least comparing to chapters 1 and 2).Overall it's a decent continuation, and a good evolution of the storyline, but somehow less exciting than the previous chapters."},{"users":"vpashokkumar","ratings":"6","titles":"Everyone becomes a superhero without shooting skill","reviews":"Everyone in the movie gets killed, but they return quickly and continue fighting.

There are some stunts that are fresh from the oven, it's the first time it's been done in the history of filmmaking. The pacing is frenetic and the action sequences are jaw-droppingly awesome, you'll never get enough of them.A special shoutout to the cinematography team. Every time Mr Wick is punching, kicking, smashing and every other verb you can think of, the cameras have their ways of putting us on a ride; like a curious kid standing close only feet apart watching everything happening before his eyes. It is breathtaking, it is vibrant and it really feels like we're there with John Wick.Some may ask if the franchise is getting ridiculous since it has now come to the 4th entry. Well, it may have come a long way as the start of the franchise was a revenge made because of a dog and a car but we will deny anyone saying it's starting to become like the F&F saga. John Wick 4 still very much relevant and it stays true to what the franchise is about, but only this time it is bigger, bolder and more brutal.Chapter 4 does not only offer violent fighting pieces, but somewhere in-between, you will find a meaningful and fascinating story of humanity. The thematic elements of friends, family and honor are the central aspects, proving that even with its bloodbath, pornfest of violence, the movie still cares about pouring its heart and love from these human values that we cherish.Focusing only on a few characters, their motives and agendas are what made the story moves forward. Each character has something they want or need to do to survive and the stakes are high because everyone here is formidable.However, because there isn't many long-running characters left, it may be a drag for some audience. John Wick 4 isn't the same like the other 3, it is heavier, bloodier, and its neo-noir looks are refined and richer, it'll make you feel you're watching Blade Runner 2049 instead. Some will appreciate its tonal shift but others won't accept the new look, feel and heavy-themed stories.We cannot overlook at the fact that some action scenes are heavily choreographed to the extent that it may take away some of the good experiences as you may be aware of the idea that it looks staged. Yes, all John Wick films have great stunt choreography and there are times where it felt like they overdid some scenes, putting them in a way that felt like it's not realistic. However, this entry has the most unnaturally stage-like scenes especially the first major battle scene that takes place in a building.A lot might disagree with our opinion here but man, do we feel that the action here isn't enough. 2 hours 49 mins but there are only 3 major fighting scenes. We love all of them but honestly, we're expecting so much more. We went in thinking that the fighting part will take about 70% of the movie, with a lot of early reviews saying that it is a non-stop action film. But we're let down by the amount of action scenes. So folks, don't go in with a high expectation that there's gonna be a lot of fights. There are plenty but it's just isn't enough for us. We want more.Verdict: Defining the action genre, John Wick Chapter 4 offers an orgy of violence, nail-biting kinetic action sequences that will set the bar for the rest of the one man army movies in decades to come. It may not be THE best John Wick film but WOW, this is first class entertainment at its finest."},{"users":"bbigdiddle","ratings":"7","titles":"This is gonna be unpopular","reviews":"Entertaining ?

The film seemed to be redundant at times as John would fight a bunch of guys for 20 minutes straight then drive to another location and fight a bunch of guys for 20 minutes straight.The new characters introduced in this film were pretty cool and it was great to see actors like Scott Adkins and Donnie Yen get cast in a major block buster after paying their dues for many years in lesser known films.The filming location were great and and the cinematography was top notch.John came across in the film as somewhat one dimensional as he barely spoke 300 words in the nearly 3 hour film, but of course actions speak louder than words.Personally I would have liked to have seen the film dedicate a little more time to show the history and inner workings of the high table as I have always felt that this mysterious and ritualistic organization really helped make the films unique.I'm summary, god action film, but missed some opportunities to make it really memorable."},{"users":"mahdinaimi","ratings":"1","titles":"Insult to your sanity","reviews":"I normally don't write reviews but this movie just pushed the boundaries of absurdity so far that I just can't say nothing!We get it, John Wick never dies, OK!But at least put a tiny bit of reason into the movie!! He jumps out of the window from the third floor, lands on car, THE CAR'S ROOF GETS SMASHED!!!, but he just stands up and continues fighting???And some scenes are so ridiculous that the whole cinema was laughing. Like the scene near the ending where he is literally just rolling himself down the staircase for no reason! You can literally see him push his arms to the ground to roll one more stair flight down!Even if you don't think about what you're watching, the action scenes get boring too quickly! Repetitive style of fighting, same movements from Chapter 1, and then covering themselves from bullets with just a sleeve (???) And then penetrating that sleeve with a knife!I felt like Keanu Reeves was just telling me \"Give me your money and don't think about what I'm showing you, cuz I like the money!\"Seriously! The movie had nothing new to show! Same old story... same old fighting... literally nothing new! We get it, you make good fortune out of this! But at least have SOMETHING NEW when you're taking your audience's bucks.... for example, the three other chapters had at least some good dialogs, but this one.... maybe it's me, but Keanu's performance is just going down in these kind of movies...."},{"users":"raven-11881","ratings":"7","titles":"Overrated Action-Movie","reviews":"Saw it yesterday at the cinema. Well, I can't quite agree with the praise.The film is clearly too long, the action scenes all get out of hand and you only see more of the same killing scenes, which are boring and tough in the long run. Less would have been more here.Attention, there are a few spoilers to a few fight scenes.Chapter 4 takes the \"nonsense\" to the extreme again. I'm a fan of well choreographed fights, but not when it's just overplayed to the max. John Wick once again fights HORDES of assassins and walking fortresses, but they are all too stupid to hit John and always miss. It's also interesting that John Wick must think he's Neo, since he's constantly \"dodging\" bullets by ducking and taking slight sideways steps. By John being invincible, it's just not fun to watch him kill, because it's unsatisfying victory, kind of like a cheat in a game or some kind of god mode. It would have been much more intense and emotional for me as a viewer if John was significantly more vulnerable and if there had been more noticeable character development and motivation. It would have been enough to reduce the kill count from over 200 to under 20, but to stage the individual fights more brutally, more intensively and, above all, more realistically and credibly (e.g. As in Atomic Blonde or Mission: Impossible).I also find these \"armored\" suit guys stupid. John often shoots whole magazines at these guys, and the bullets bounce off the suit as if the outer fabric was already made of 1 cm steel. But the fact that the suit guys are still very agile is even more laughable. And the suits are still as clean and intact as if they had just been bought and ironed. These suit guys don't have head protection, though, which is why I find it ridiculous that John imemr shoots at their bodies and not directly at their heads. He seems to be shortsighted, because he only ever shoots at the head when he's extremely close to the enemy. However, when enemies wear complete body armor including ballistic helmets, John strangely always shoots at their heads even from a distance, until after ten or fifteen shots he finally shoots into the helmet\/head from below. If you multiply these kind of kills by 100, you have an idea of how often John kills hundreds of killers in the same way.Furthermore, I find it very nonsensical that there are no police in the world who intervene at times.The scene in Paris at this big traffic circle with several lanes is also totally crazy. John and the killers shoot at each other on the traffic circle for over ten minutes, and the \"civilians\" just drive on like robots at 50 km\/h and just keep running over some killers and John, though John never takes any damage from it. But no one stops, gets out and runs away in fear. The traffic keeps flowing, despite wild killing by shooting and wild running over.As for the staging of the action scenes: For every well-staged action scene, there are unfortunately three mediocre and boring action scenes that always follow the same pattern, see my comments above. And even the best action scenes are not necessarily as \"groundbreaking\" or \"novel\" and \"groundbreaking\" as some critics claim. I found a whole two action scenes very successful, once the much too short! (where all the others are way too long) chase scene in the Mustang and once the top-down fight scene. The highly praised staircase fight scene I found again much too long and also very 08\/15, because John again makes his always same kills, while all the others always hit only the staircase railings or lanterns, but not John.The story isn't worth mentioning and doesn't make much sense in terms of content. Interestingly enough, the nice dialogues and dialogue scenes are still one of the best things about the movie.The sound is well mixed though, the camerawork is well done and the visuals are very aesthetically pleasing and there are a few nice references to Matrix (rain fight scene and the train station).Now all of this sounds rather like a poor or mediocre rating, but that wouldn't do the film justice. It offers good entertainment on a technical level above mediocrity and Keanu Reeves is always fun to watch. Therefore I still give it a solid rating, despite all my reservations.Rating: 7\/10 pointsRewatch Value: LowEmotional depth: LowLasting impression: None."},{"users":"trusso-36531","ratings":"10","titles":"Unprecedentedly great","reviews":"The cinematography was some of the best I've seen in any movie holding up to films like blade runner and interstellar.

I was genuinely surprised by that first movie: original, exciting yet realistic fight sequences, a main character and plot you were invested in, and although Keanu isn't a great actor, his lack of dialogue and a great supporting cast more than made up for it.The 2nd and 3rd movies took us on a journey into this mysterious underground world, but set up more than it delivered. The action scenes were starting to get a little repetitive and unrealistic, but the intrigue of the plot kept us interested.My expectation was that this movie would deliver a lot more with regards to story, but it fell flat. Nothing that was set up previously was resolved in a satisfactory way. The action scenes were ridiculous, the characters unoriginal, and the movie was just way too long. I was literally yawning as hundreds of supposed hit-men who couldn't hit anything were killed again and again.Before this 4th instalment, I was thinking of adding the John Wick franchise to my Blu-ray collection, but now I will just buy the first one as it works well as a standalone movie and is far superior to the rest."},{"users":"padabhade","ratings":"10","titles":"OMG!

This all means that you feel immersed into the world of John Wick and the High Table.You do need to suspend belief whilst watching John Wick. He's almost at superhero levels and it feels like John Wick could give Neo a run for his money at this point. There were some sequences that made me think his character was invincible despite the filmmakers doing their best to shown his vulnerabilities.That being said, you know what you are getting when you watch John Wick.

The story is somewhat secondary to the action which is absolutely fine. The cinematography is very clean, the characters are interesting and the locations look great.My main hang-up with the John Wick movies and more modern action is ironically the fight scenes. Since there are so many, it all ends up following the same patterns. 50 guys will show up, he'll shoot two or three at a time, there will randomly be a big gap when he can run out of ammo or drop his weapon to do a mini fight and MMA takedown pick up another conveniently placed gun and headshot them. Then instantly some more guys turn up only when he's ready but he'll also miss the miniboss henchmen despite hitting everything else with headshots, rinse and repeat. It is too choreographed, even when they try to make it look like he could possibly lose.I'm fine with suspending some disbelief when it comes to these things because it is fantastical, but the issue is that it's a little repepetive and there are next to no stakes the more it happens especially since he wears literal plot armour. Plus if you look at any background henchman during these things there are weird time fills. There's literally a part in this when he's fighting one guy and someone in the background stands up and hugs a drum and falls back down because they're clearly having to wait and it's just out of place. Especially when you have Donnie Yen in your movie who famously does fight scenes with multiple people all at once.I do like that they change it up a bit with the car scene and the gunfight shot from overhead, the real shining moments of this movie are they go through with everyone essentially \"winning\" but still had the courage to end the movie the way they did because they could easily have chickened out. Plus of course big points for the whole dog part, it had the best story, best action and best humour and arguably the best ending."},{"users":"safayaturrahman","ratings":"10","titles":"It is a insane of jonh wick franchises..","reviews":"It is so much attractive for other 3 chapter.The beauty is on of the places.

Videogame-like pedestrians, partygoers and car drivers that just keep ignoring the carnage taking place all around them, driving past or running over dozens of bad guys with guns and assault rifles.... As if nothing was happening at all around them.Where are all the police officers in this world?? Not a single police car showing up at any location at all. Ludicrous.The guys that made this movie are just videogame junkies. They have spent way too much time playing with cartoonish characters that fall off a building, land on a van and stand up like nothing with zero bones broken just because.... I don't know, the John Wick's health and energy bars keep replenishing themselves as the time goes by.Somebody at the helm should have watched movies like John Frankenheimer's Ronin for a little bit of inspiration.Jon Wick 3 Parabellum was lots of fun and felt like a great cinematic experience because aside endless and exhausting fighting scenes it continued and followed a story woven through 2 previous movies. Because the storyline didn't feel contrived and really felt like a conclusion, because it made sense and because John had a clear, defined and achievable purpose. And also because the world and characters of this Universe were opened up, expanded and we got to see new interesting characters and locations.But part 4 just recycles some things from part 3 and try to stretch the bubble gum just a bit too much. I thought Lawerence Fishburne was to play a greater role but he is there just for fan service. It almost seemed like John was out there killing for the sake of killing for 3 straight hours. Period.And I cannot fully convey my astonishment at this world of Parisien NPCs that cannot be bothered by the thunderous sound of blazing bullets and the corpses piling up on the roads in the early hours of the morning nearby one of the main touristic attractions of Paris. Does anybody live in those places? Nahhh... Duels and events organized by criminal organizations can now take place everywhere they want anytime without any people showing up or giving two-pence about any bloodshed taking place around them.

The amount of stunt choreography and synchronization required is simply incredible, and the film continues to find new ways to entertain with kills, use of weapons, locations, teamwork, and much more.What really stands out, however, is the dazzlingly lit environments and the music that kicks as much butt as what you see on screen. Many of the action scenes take place at night, and the lighting is simply stunning, resulting in a visually stunning film that is a feast for the eyes and the ears.The introduction of new characters in this world, including Donnie Yen and Rina Sawayama, adds to the excitement and makes for an even more enjoyable experience. While Keanu Reeves may be less nimble at his age, he still manages to deliver an impenetrable force that is a force to be reckoned with.While there may be some plot armor to forgive, the longer takes and overall action sequences make up for it.

The skills and fortitude presented by the character added the action to an action movie.The following movies John wick -4 SERIOUSLY lack in any sort of storyline except guns, killing and an unrealistic ability to not get shot dead in a hail of a million bullets fired by 'professional' Sicarios.The latest instalment was absolutely no different, the storyline is weak and boring, the main character must be a god to not die in the usual hail of bullets AND being run over more than 3 times.TBH I towards the end in the stairwell scene I was WISHING someone would just kill the John there and then, after all he's just fallen hundreds of stone steps, gets up and starts again... Total Bull.The usual bull of the good guy being able to kill a hundred hardened criminal well armed fighters just to be thwarted by a single unimpressive and willowy man is rife within the movie industry, Its a shame they also applied such a ridiculous storyline in this movie.Thankfully then end scene was a total surprise, that part alone was worth the price of the popcorn, but not the hotdog!THANKFULLY his character is dead.. Or is he?"},{"users":"jumperjames-51960","ratings":"9","titles":"Typical Wickness","reviews":"After a drop off in story quality a bit with parts 2 and 3, John Wick is doing what he does best - building up a huge body count.A totally coherent plot is not necessary for these. However it is nice to see a modicum of effort involved. Our story here will not win any awards, but it's just a series of flimsy excuses to have endless fight scenes play out. Lots of ammunition is expended, lots of people are kicked, thrown around and punched. And if you enjoy seeing people meeting an unfortunate encounter with a vehicle (moving or stationary), you will not be disappointed.All the John Wick films have a 1990's era Homg Kong action movie vibe.

Keanu's best acting in my personal opinion. So much words of wisdom said and yet so much actions done at the same time. It's a realistic movie, not just your typical action film. John Wick is a man of reason. There are a few comedic banters in the film that just make it so much better. I'm usually the type to not finish a movie in one sitting. I easily get carried away or bored, but this masterpiece right here kept me entertained for three hours straight. I was laughing, I was scared, I was weeping, and I was serious. So many emotions for one great film. I rarely give 10 star reviews but this one deserves it most. You know it's a 10\/10 if you're willing to watch it over and over and over again, and still love it every single time. Amazing film! Highly recommend watching! Great end to the series!

They overdid the fight sequences. John Wick didn't have as much as a scratch on his face till the end of the movie. Falling from buildings and getting hit by cars and being fired at with 100s of bullets and still remaining unharmed was too unrealistic.The blind guy was even more unbelievable than anything else and was a poor addition to the franchise.The guy with the dog had a target on John Wick throughout the movie, except when he agreed to kill him. Then he couldn't manage to kill him.Not sure where all the henchmen got their training from, but after 3 previous movies they should've known that was not a credible place to train and their outcome was missing 10 shots and getting shot in the head themselves."},{"users":"Aayush_Shah","ratings":"7","titles":"Will this chapter continue 7.4 trend too?","reviews":"This really is a 4th chapter. 4x action, 4x dialogues, 4x visuals and stunts are literally amazing.I wanted a bit more \"involved\" story. It is simple continuation of the last chapter but some \"tweaks\" needed. Yes, the last scene will shock you for sure but without it you will need to want more.Yes of course, whatever shown in the first 3 episodes are summarised and when John is dying in the last scene that won't make you cry but will make you want him more and a sence of relief that he is now free from all the BS he faced.So overall it is a good movie, I would love it more if the fighting scenes were taken in a different way than they did in the last 3 chapters. Some new angles, slow and closeup scenes etc will make it a lit."},{"users":"yuomo-98641","ratings":"10","titles":"\"Yeah....\"","reviews":"The John Wick franchise has never let me down.The first John Wick film stands out because at that time, no one had ever seen an American action movie pull off some of the sequences that it did. It had a clear and simple story about revenge. You hurt someone and something I loved and now I'm coming after you. The first film is flawless.The second film took what we already knew of John Wick and what he is capable of and raised the bar a little.Even though people can't stand Chapter 3, I always thought it did a pretty awesome job in expending on the lore and world surrounding this character. It had phenomenal action sequences and visually, it was beautiful.In my honest opinion, JW4 is the best entry of this entire franchise. Yes, even better than the original. This film has a near 3 hour run time that never feels like it and that entire time is filled with non-stop action. I find it incredible how these films could continue to pump out jaw-dropping moments four movies in but, yup, they definitely did it here. It's also got a lot of heart. For a movie that absolutely needs no expansion of story to please it's core audience, this movie still had it. The new characters that are introduced are awesome as well. Donnie Yen's Caine is probably my favorite character in all of the films.This movie has the best action, the best cinematography and the highest stakes of all four movies.If you haven't seen it yet, please do.It's action movie perfection."},{"users":"abhiraiar","ratings":"9","titles":"Just Don't Miss The Madness on Big Screen \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udd25","reviews":"Movie starts and takes a little bit time build up & then skyrockets the action sequences set the bar high x1,000 for any upcoming movies like by far one of the \"Best Action Movies Ever Made\" the whole Osaka fight, one take room gun fire sequences, everything is just \"Keanu Reeves as usual again his best more next level\" & \"Donnie Yen as Caine nailed it\" everything with a proper good story was excepting more but it is fine & when you thought it can't get more crazier then comes whole bike & car sequences it is meant for big screens biggest possible for you & then whole climax John Wick & Caine together wish they already announce Chapter 5 & movie contains credit at the very end so don't go just watch it people it will be a an experience."},{"users":"erkarhu","ratings":"1","titles":"What a disappointment","reviews":"I was really excited about this movie since it had such good reviews in here.

Plot didn't move forward at all. Fighting scenes were EXTREMELY long and unrealistic. Acting was poor and hard to watch.

This is a action movie Junkies dream come true!The movie runs a little bit long, almost 3 hours, and is even more brutally violent than the previous films. The violence got almost ridiculous. The entire movie is a bloody Slaughter Fest! I became jaded to the overload. But then I realize that is exactly what has happened to John Wick and that is the whole point of the film.

John Wick: Chapter 4, and the franchise in general, will go down as one of the greatest modern day classics of are time. This franchise has give us some of the most incredible moments put to film in decades with some of most brutal and insane stunts put to screen in a long time. This film does so much right. Starting of strong with the incredibly stacked cast that are all used to their fullest potential, the film stars Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Ian McShane, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, Rina Sawayama, Clancy Brown, Shamier Anderson, Laurence Fishburne, Hiroyuki Sanada, and the late Lance Reddick. Reeves once again kills the roles of John Wick. The new comers also kick butt with their roles. Sharsg\u00e5rd and Yen both do incredible jobs as The Marquis and Caine respectively. The cinematography and stunts were orgasmic. The many locations Wicks goes to in this film are shot so well. The Japan, warehouse fight, and the dual sequences were shot with so much depth and precision. The camera did some of the most impressive things I've seen on film. The stunts were brutal and downright impressive at times. Noteable stunts like the Japanese continental fight, the warehouse, and the steps to the church, and many more were, at their core a tribute to the stunt people. The action was immensely great and the writing was on point. The two hour and fifty minute runtime flew by. I'm the end, John Wick: Chapter 4 is the perfect end for the franchise. Wicks story only had one ending as foreshadow and told to us in the past three films. His story comes full circle in this entire and what a gut punch of a circle it is. A must watch!"},{"users":"mvanek-48586","ratings":"9","titles":"Wow","reviews":"Dude I just saw this film last night and it was absolutely phenomenal.

You leave actually wanting a little bit more. They really leaned into the stylized action and did it properly. Eastern, European, and Western action all blend together perfectly and how John Wick adapts to every situation and weapon just shows how amazing he truly is and why he's the Baba Yaga. Yes there are times where you would think \"how are they not dead\", but it's the same with some bad guys too. Just get lost in the action and story, because it tugs at the emotions too and shows you John is just a guy who wants peace but everything keeps bringing him back in.P. S.

(As I hoped)The John Wick movies stand out from other American action films that heavily rely on CGI and poorly written scripts.The John Wick franchise is a breath of fresh air with its fast-paced storyline, mesmerizing stunts, and remarkable choreography that leaves you in awe.

There is this lore and deep mythology, with its codes and numerous complex links... Which all make for an extremely tasty action movie, that offers martial arts and\/or action scenes that are equally groundbreaking and unique in the way that it renders and impacts your experience as a movie viewer. There clearly are three-four long sequences that make you feel like you're witnessing something special... It's intense, creative, beautifully shot, nicely paced and of course perfectly staged. The photography is exquisite from beginning to end (it puts you in awe a couple of times)... And the whole piece is magnificently served by a plethoric cast of very very high quality...It might be pure action, but like the greatest adventure-action movies in history, it has several powerful sceneries\/settings\/locations that obviously add-up to the fine taste the movie leaves you... Also, the few story bits that punctuate the movie are a delight that thickens the whole experience, leading the way towards some cool twists and outcomes...Overall, a true masterpiece, for sure.This Chapter 4 of John Wick very much places itself in the heights of Kill Bill 1&2...

I think, I was very attached to the character of John Wick, but I think that no movie in the series has so far surpassed the first movie, which combined action and drama, but the action later.. especially in this chapter did not succeed in this formula, as it was a very long film, it bored me many times.And after I sympathized with John Wick as a strong or even superhuman in the beginning, from the second chapter to this chapter, I interacted with him as if he was a robot.Yes, the action is very good, but the long fighting scenes did not present anything new, and their repetition did not make them the climax of the events, but rather a regular thing, as the fighting scene was repeated among dancers and among street cars... without any reaction, so that I could almost swear that the NPCs in GTA games will react better.This does not mean that I hated the movie, but if I miss the character of John Wick, I will always go to watch the first part, which is the part that I will recommend to others with enthusiasm."},{"users":"Hey_Harry","ratings":"10","titles":"John Wick 4 is pure action-packed cinema","reviews":"Depending on its theatrical run, John Wick 4 is slated to be the final film in the John Wick franchise. That being said, John Wick: Chapter 4 definitely stands out as the most hard-hitting action film in the series and a satisfying conclusion to one of the best action franchises in recent years. The optimist in me however still hopes there'll be a John Wick 5 or at least a spin-off franchise. The only minor complaint I have is that John Wick 4 doesn't have the same elements of world-building lore that made the previous films so engaging but John Wick 4 more than makes up for it with pure elements of non-stop action and impressive fight choreography which make sure to push Wick to his absolute limit. The action is so intense at times that I was actually felt out of breath while watching Wick battle through multiple waves of minions and assassins. John Wick 4 includes an excellent cast of heroes and villains, including Donnie Yen and Scott Adkins, who are all phenomenal in the film.

Any action flick like these you have to suspend your imagination, but between JW1 and JW4, well you might as well remove your brain before stepping in to the theater. I appreciated JW1 because he got hurt and you could see the suffering as the film went on. The shooting and fight scenes were tactical and tight and extremely well coordinated. JW2, little more suspension with the bullet proof suit, \"but it's gonna hurt\". And it did. He got hit by a couple cars, eh ok it's a movie. He got stitched up here and there, etc. But by the time we get to JW4, bullets are now bouncing off the bullet proof suit that everyone is wearing, not using cover and just covering their head with the coat, getting hit by cars at full speed over and over and over and then dropping from 2 stories, crushing the roof of a van and just chugging along.

John Wick will always remain one of my favourite characters in any storyline or movie and his epic character has been brought to justice with the john wick movie series. The camera angles in some of the scenes are also super unique and the fighting style of Mr. Wick is iconic as well as the actors that have been picked for the roles.

Chapter that takes part in Berlin is possibly the worst these movies have ever been featuring terrible slow motion combat and comic relief bad guys - By the way, the main antagonist is also increadibly one dimensional.The conclusion was done rather well though. After 2+ hours I surely didnt expect 2 of the best fight scenes in recent memory (The shotgun rampage and stairway fight using a Justice song).The ending was just what it needed to be without being too dragged out.I didn't even notice the music most of the time besides of what I mentioned above. While John Wick 1 & 2 used original Music and had a great OST everything here is either reused or straight up licensed.Overall I think the other JW films did their thing better than this one but the action is obviously superb.

This movie is made to watch only in cinemas or you will be cheating to yourself. The action sequences were madness and a lot of stylish music and settings were there throughout the movie. Never seen more stylish movie in all sense from start to finish. The theme of John Wick as a God was still intact as he just couldn't die and everyone fears him. Even a city full of people couldn't kill this mad man. Only thing I don't like about this or few other John Wick movies was that he doesn't has a motive to not die. A back story why he is so damn robust could be shown or maybe in future installments.One crazy casino scene was so mad and my absolute favorite which shows the ridiculousness of this franchise which is so uber cool. Only madmax fury road was another mad movie like this in action genre. If this is not the best action movie ever than definitely not far behind either.

The action was getting tedious after a while and the last 45 minutes I was getting bored. Nothing was really going on and the plot development wasn't there.Now, it's fun to go escape for nearly 3 hours, but I highly doubt this is going to hold up with repeat viewings. And like I said, the other 3 were far more superior than this, since there seemed to be an actual plot.Now the pros. The cinematography was top notch, and Connie Yen stole the show and this movie will make him into a mega star. His character, (a blind assassin) is so much fun, I can see them doing a spin off on him and it could work if done right.But this movie could have cut about 30 to 45 minutes. And there were some scenes, like John Wick falling off unbelievable heights and getting up unscathed that took me out. There is just no way that is possible and really took me out of suspending my belief. The movie was cartoonish at times and I felt I was watching Loony Toons with some of the stunts.So, basically, the movie is a fun popcorn flick, but because it has no whit, no humor and can get tedious from time to time, I can only give it 6 stars. Next time, put some things in there to stimulate our brains."},{"users":"ringdrossel","ratings":"5","titles":"Great camerawork but this movie is meaningless","reviews":"As the main antagonist says himself John Wick has no motivation.

There were even some scenes the entire cinema laughed during his rather serious fights. Especially the last hour it drags on and on.One thing worth mentioning though is the amazing camerawork.

It does start off a little slower than the last movie as far as the insane action but It's one of the best written JWs yet(at least in my opinion) and the story is partially why the action takes just a hair longer to get to. But not to worry cause the action comes and it comes strong! By now we all know what to expect from the JW movies and if we are watching them, it's because we enjoy what they offer. For me this movie is one of the best written as far as the story goes. I truly enjoyed learn about the parts of the table previously unknown. I'm not sure how I would feel it they ever did these movies without Keanu (as a spin off or something, not even sure I'd give them a chance.)

Even for an unprofessional eye like mine the stunts look so well choreographed and the way they're shot is so perfectly executed that gives you the feeling you're almost there(that's why I recommend you to see it on IMAX, if you have the opportunity). On the other hand, because of the length of the movie you could get exhausted by all the fighting or at least l did. That also made me think - okay, Jon Wick is a really well trained killer, but where is the source of its stamina, because I'm not sure if even a professional athlete would be capable to keep up with all of these unstoppable running, wrestling and fighting(don't forget that an UFC fight is at most 25 minutes).

This had all the creativity and diversity you would expect from a John Wick movie plus a little more. The stunt team is still working hard to bring set-pieces and direction that have never been seen before and for that reason alone it's worth a viewing. A word of warning, however, myself and some others have complaints about the audio being too loud at time. Leaving the theatre afterwards, I still had the sound of the gunshots lingering in my ears. On paper, there is nothing about this movie that does not meet expectations. However, by watching this movie I've learned how much the emotional stakes of the first movie were important. John Wick's character is heavy minimized compared to previous movies and the change, for me, was hard to get over. At this point in the franchise I need to stakes to be higher than ever, but the story comes across as a little directionless and it's not quite clear what John is fighting for anymore. The movie introduces new side characters and gives them depth and driving factors which makes the audience route for them, while simultaneously pointing out the lack of motivation John has to even live. At the end of this three hour movie I'm not sure what changed for the characters involved and that's a pretty big problem for a movie to have.

It's the killing that gives you purpose.\"A film should not have ambitions more than its worth but when the ambitions grow in line with the box office grosses with each installment cascading in stature it must face the consequence of expectations. This is what John Wick as a brand has achieved over the years and Chapter 4 is by far its best gift.It is a love letter to cinema and filmmaking at large where action, no longer used as a prop, takes centerstage and is celebrated by ballerinas like Keanu Reeves, and Donnie Yen who dignify the space with their own charm and metallic personality. Stunning to say the least. Well choreographed endless string of eye-popping action sequences - 14 in the finale act are a match made in heaven like ebbs visible only for a moment. The high table just shatters with those bombs one after the other anhilating the screen to smithereens.Overall, John Wick along with the awe inspiring tonality brushed with magnificent camera work and excruciatingly long set pieces tricks you into a dreamy state of ecstasy and establishes a benchmark that will go down in history as a thesis on how to make memorable action films. After all who would have imagined that a party scene would show people with authority fighting their own hideous battles in the background unwithered by the careless mob taking care of business by recklessly dancing to the beats without substance.

While a lot of it will have you saying to yourself, \"there's no way he survives this\", you quickly will remember that's part of the lore of the John Wick movies and you don't care anymore.

I won't spoil anything although the third act was the best part of the film in terms of action and suspense. I personally think this is the best action franchise since the Jason Bourne films.

It's so colorful and so nice to look at and they also change location a lot so there's a lot of variety and creative fight scenes.In this movies they also introduce a lot of new characters and they're all awesome . My favorite character is Donnie Yen he's is really charismatic and got a creative way of fighting and he's appear throughout the whole movie not just some side character that studio give a little screen time just to get some quick money from a fan.The story I think it's better than quite a few people said. It's not a masterpiece in story telling or anything but it's fun. The pacing is nice. It's have a lot of cool character moments. It's not waste to much time to get you from action to action scenes and I think it's conclude in a satisfying way. Lot of funny stuff too.If i had to nitpicking I'd say the villians is not that great but the real antogonist is Donnie Yen anyway. And there's a few time you just have to suspend disbelief a little bit like a dance culb scene for example. They go for amazing aesthetic and not so much a realistic depiction.Oh and the use of soundtrack and music is awesome.All and all just a really fun action well shot film that will keep you entertained for nearly 3 hours and this come from a guy that's not an action movie fan.

Chapter 2 were perfect action films with a properly motivated protagonist, incredible action scenes, and sharp editing that kept the pacing tight. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum was a slight letdown plotwise, but still a very good entry that expanded the Wick mythology. That brings us to the wildly overpraised, disappointing Chapter 4. Yes, the action scenes are still jaw-dropping, but there are too many of them and they last for too long. It was the first time I was ever bored in a John Wick movie! Screenwriter Derek Kolstad did not have a hand in writing this one, which may partially explain the silly plot. After all Wick has gone through, it seems he just has to kill a High Table member--put in charge of his termination--in a one-on-one duel to end his troubles. Really? And then when we finally reach the climatic duel, two professional killers can't manage a head shot from a distance of 40 paces? I know...maybe they weren't trying to kill each other. But each one knew that the duel had to result in a death. That's the stinkin' High Table rules! A bigger problem, though, is the almost three-hour running time. It may allow time to introduce more characters, but we don't get to know most of them. Wick's friend Shimazu is introduced and killed off. John's adoptive sister Katia is a promising character, but only has two quick scenes. Charon, one of the best characters in the series, is executed in the first half-hour. Honestly, I hope there is not a John Wick: Chapter 5. I own the first three films and will undoubtedly revisit them in the future.

Unrealistic because the skill with which every single fighter in the movie (and there are literally hundreds if not thousands of them) can dodge bullets is ridiculous. Suffice to say, the ratio of gunshots on target at close range (within 1-2 metres) is about 1 in 10. Either the fighters are impossibly good at dodging bullets or else they have become so adept at unarmed combat that their gun firing skills have become nonexistent."},{"users":"qumbernasim","ratings":"9","titles":"Tremendous Action","reviews":"What a sequel - glad I made my time today with such a mind ravishing and brain stimulative action and real time videography especially in indoor drone coverage and over the top of it the ballistic were so powerfully sounded that every bullets was deeply attained with audio effects.

I like the way he walks and talks with a singular rhythm. Sets the tone for a lot of the scenes. Like a native English speaking Terminator.Firstly much appreciation for the stunt work. There are a lot of impressive things in here but the simple, relatively speaking, falls require a lot of work and generally they look great. Some, probably all, of the fight scenes drag on too long although special mention to the sequence in a building shot from above. I thought that was superb.Some of the set design is beautiful. Some of the shots that appear on screen are not and look cheap, in todays terms. When you see the film you'll know what I mean. Sunrise over Paris anyone?Lots of action and in keeping with the previous films lots of honourable reasons for that action.Not sure the concept of mixing a film with a dodgy Bond villain with Bourne like action scenes and a major character from Blind Fury is a great idea.If you do get bored watching this film you can play, \"Place the Accent\"There are no prizes but you might struggle to work out where anyone is fromNice to see Clancy Brown and the dog was fantastic without having to rely on the \"cute animal\" syndrome.

Incredible production values and earnest acting and amazing stunts by all involved. Wardrobe, foley, set designers, editors, and MUAs were all the best of the best.And yet the movie was a complete waste of time. I want it to make money for all involved, but I can't say that it was a good movie by any stretch of the imagination.The American fetishization of guns was in full force here, as was the American hyperbole: \"Make it bigger, make it crazier, make it more wacky.\" This film had all of that, but...character development? Forget about it. A plot that made sense? No way. An emotional through line? Barely.It's true that we care about John Wick. We became invested in him four movies ago when they killed his dog. But watching this film is like watching that dog race around the room covered in tinsel and holidays lights, barking at shadows.How many real-world problems can be solved by shooting something in the head? Twice? How many different ways to kill do we really need depicted on a seventy-five-foot screen? How much more glorification of psychotic criminal behavior must we really witness before we ourselves become psychotic?This movie is like porn for gun nuts or for people who feel that they can punch their way out of their problems. There's a certain comedy about this that is kind of endearing. But it's just too much. There's a recurring theme that John can't escape whom he is and so he should stop trying. Is that what we should do as well? God, I hope there's more to life than that nihilism.The best scene in the film embraced a Sisyphean ideal that, in its absurdity, was worth viewing. And maybe that's the point. Maybe John Wick is just crazy enough to make us stop and ask, \"Are we the crazy ones for viewing this? Can we ever be anything more? Should we try to find deeper meaning in our lives and relationships?\" I certainly hope so."},{"users":"christopher-j-hughes","ratings":"2","titles":"Boring spectacle","reviews":"Left after 75mins.

I saw a lot of the more negative reviews saying this film felt more Bond esc than John Wick, going into the film I didn't understand what they meant but now I completely get it. John Wick first premiered in theatres 9 years ago and was a small hearty revenge tale action film that over time picked up a large audience of fans (me included). Much like any film that picks up a fan base it gets a sequel and now we're 4 films deep and going back to the whole bond thing this feels like the 4th film in an action film franchise and by that I mean everything is bigger, bigger and more stars, bigger and longer action set pieces and a bigger and more complex plot. Bigger however doesn't always mean better it's about what you do with it and what these films have done is turned into a franchise in every sense of the word. Lost is that small revenge thriller feel of the first film and now we have over the top villains like Bill Skarsgard who comes across as less menacing and more spoilt brat. We also have a protagonist that feels invincible at points laughably so, for instance John jumps out of a third floor window at one point lands on his back on top of a van and almost instantly gets up and walks off. There were a few of these 'yeah right' moments and they really took me out of the film temporarily. That being said however the film is far from a total lost, Donnie Yen is by far the stand out addition to the franchise, he steals every scene he's in and I definitely have a craving to go and watch more of his earlier work now. The action sequences despite being over the top at points are as slick and well choreographed as they were in the previous films and almost feel like a dance just a bloody and brutal one. The ending is also really solid and something we haven't seen before in a John Wick film, the film definitely leaves you on a high note.I definitely enjoyed this film but compared to the other John Wick films it's down there with three as one of the weaker entries in the franchise for me.I hope they stick with four films and that it doesn't get anymore over the top as after all"},{"users":"jazzinplayer","ratings":"8","titles":"John Wick at its best!!","reviews":"This movie is just too good.

It's precisely as expected: brutal in some ways, artful in others. Unfortunately, at certain points you really have to wonder if they ran out of choreographers when the fights seem to drag on rather excessively and without much variation. Improvised weaponry was rarer than before, and you'd kind of expect some variety in it. Most of all, some of the choreography is downright lazy. There are points in fight scenes where men wearing Kevlar lined 3 piece suits take multiple bullets, which make little sparks and they're otherwise unfazed. They wrote John this absurd trick where he holds up his suit jacket like Batman's cape and now he's magically immune to bullets. Each movie departed from realism a bit more; this chapter just threw it in the trash. It's just a superhero movie without powers.Now the story, on the other hand, leaves much more to be desired. The pacing is incredibly slow, to the point where you sometimes just lose the plot entirely. Very few familiar characters spend more than a few minutes on screen, and the new characters who hog the spotlight are shallow and forgettable.Lastly, the pacing is awful, in some part due to the large run time. Fight scenes drag on far too long, while most conversations are so short and unsubstantial that they might as well not have occurred at all. I truly hope this was studio pressure, and that Stahelski releases a director's cut to remedy this. I can only assume there's dialog and complex choreography that were cut in lieu of the popcorn stuff."},{"users":"barrymcvea-68082","ratings":"7","titles":"John wick chapter 4","reviews":"John wick chapter 4 was probably the best John wick yet it was alot better than chapter 3 for sure.

They continue where previous left and build on each other really nicely.And Chapter 4 is the biggest, boldest and the most beautiful of them all.

It annoys me that he falls from high altitudes, gets hit and goes on like nothing; always attack him with pistols instead of machine guns or grenades that would be more effective to kill him. It doesn't have a plot almost, it's just one fight after another. Some transitions feel forced, the fights in the first half all feel the same and it gets a bit boring, only the ending escalates more.

Donnie Yen's performance was excellent and way beyond my expectations. In this film, you can't find a single actor that didn't add to the adrenaline rush and didn't contribute to Wick being an absolute menace. The entire film is an action-packed feast, and an absolute blast. 10\/10.On the other hand, the film did render me confused with the introduction of High Table and relationships between Wick's friends. It made the plot development a bit too confusing for a new viewer of the franchise. Also, John Wick's death seemed way too sudden and led straight to the end. The film communicated a solid story, 7\/10.

It has a far better story than parts 2 and 3 due to John having a more personal motivation for his typical antics. Chapter 4 also benefits from the best action sequences of the series, In parts 1, 2 and 3 there have to me only been one or two standout action scenes; the club fight in the first the entire Italy concert\/catacombs sequence in the second and the Continental hotel siege in the third. John Wick 4 on the other hand has huge fight in a hotel in Osaka, a nightclub showdown blowing the one from the first out of the water and finally the final part of the film is literally non stop action around Paris In which there's a car chase around the arc de triomphe which quickly turns into a fight in which John throws people into the oncoming traffic, a Hotline Miami style top down shootout with and finally a long fight up a tall staircase. The fourth chapter of the franchise also has the best supporting cast since the original including a brilliant Donnie Yen and the series best villain in Bill Skarsgard.

Also the plot and character motivations make absolutely no sense. It's only 5\/10 because choreography was really well done. You believe he knows how to actually shoot but at the end of the day John Wick is supposed to be human, not a mix of wolverine, Hawkeye, and have a suit that doubles as captain America's shield.

It felt fresh and new and had a convincing anti-hero with an understandable motivation. It was able to built up the necessary atmosphere of tension and suspense. A truly fun watch.Over the course of the of three sequels all that is left are stylised fight choreographies mixed with an overubandance of CGI. The general visual style throws any claim to realism over board. There is no more grounding in reality. Berlin and Paris look like comic book versions of real places that aren't inhabited by real people any more. No-one cares about a shooting in a night club or in the middle of parisian traffic at night. This could come across as an interesting artistic choice but there is no purpose to these stylistic decisions other than to make everything seem artificial and detached. On top of all of that, Wick seems almost invincible throughout the movie.And it makes the action feel impactless besides all the effort that went into the fights and shootouts.And it makes us care even less for this protagonist that has lost any sense of drive or goal. Why is he still doing what he's doing? Don't know... Should I care? It wouldn't hurt.This way the viewer gets the impression of watching a three hour demonstration of what modern Hollywood can achieve in terms of action and effects (with the occasional weak cgi background).John Wick now feels like a franchise movie that pushes on some of the strength of the original but forgets about the things that made us care in the first place. There is nothing new to see, nothing to really care for.The action has become a special effect without a purpose."},{"users":"mikedud-81751","ratings":"10","titles":"The Man. The Myth. The Legend.","reviews":"When the first John Wick movie came out, it revitalized the action movie genre. Nearly 10 years later, and two sequels in, we get arguably the best installment of the franchise. John Wick: Chapter 4 ups the ante on absolutely everything. From stunning set pieces, to non-stop high voltage action sequences.Keanu Reeves once again is breathtaking in the role of the legendary hitman. He is a true inspiration, proving that age is just a number. The guy is in his 50's and is pulling off amazing choreographed action sequences. The action sequences are incredible. Utilizing the setting around them, from Morocco to Japan to France, which subsequently makes every scene unique and a stand out. Nothing feels out of place or boring, each scene has prominence and substance to them.John Wicks war against The High Table brings him into conflict with some interesting new adversaries. Bill Skarsgards villainous role as one of the heads of The High Table is menacing, cold and calculating. He pulls the strings of the plot all the way to the end. Donnie Yen yet again plays another blind badass character. This time a hitman who has history with Wick, and a motive that forces him into hunting Wick down. A very cool and compelling character that I hope to see more of later on.The two hour and forty minute runtime went by like a breeze, captivating from the very beginning to the somber bittersweet ending. A satisfying conclusion to John Wicks story, as he was finally at peace with everything and returned home to his wife. I hope his story stays concluded, even though nowadays it seems like no one truly stays dead.In light of the conclusion I can honestly conclude that John Wick: Chapter 4 is one of the greatest action movies of all time. Subsequently, the franchise will go down in history as one of the greats, as the bar for action movies reaches a new standard."},{"users":"West-Coast-Midnight-Run","ratings":"5","titles":"Loved One and Two far more than LAME 3 and John Wick 4","reviews":"It really is not easy to put your finger on why this movie was a HUGE LETDOWN despite what critics have falsely awarded it and the fake tomato audience score. I have noted on many occasions that the audience score on Rotten Tomatoes is 85% or higher the SAME DAY the movie is released so to me it's rigged.Starring Keanu Reeves in a movie about a lone dude recovering from a painful event in life who gets bullied and assaulted by a high ranking mafia youth simply for refusing to sell him his car, John Wick in 2014 started off as a brilliant exercise in cinema entertainment but has been on a steady decline after John Wick 2.Aside from the bloated stunts and some of them implausible in the extreme (check out our John Wick 4 The Gold Members Edition at the Kiosk section of wifi midnighttracks org - add the dot in the URL or go see our profile on IMDB for address), John Wick 4 also suffers from \"borrowed\" storylines from other big franchises like 007 and Star Wars. What???? Star Wars? Cant be. Yessss be, which is why we gave it a low score. Add to it all the abundant action scenes started to make this film like an over polished FPS video game in the finest traditions of Battlefield and Crysis. I dont like to shell out my $25 so I can watch a three hour video game, I have my video games and Xbox and giant screen TV at home for that.It's not that John Wick 4 didnt have all the goodies, if you are a first timer, Wick 4 WILL BLOW YOU AWAY, if you have seen Wick 2 and Wick 3 it will be an INTENSE BORE.Co-starring Lawrence Fishburne, Donnie Yen, Ian McShane and Lance Reddick, Hiroyuki Sanada and Bill Skarsgard beware what you think you are being told by the all too familiar chorus line.

An absolutely amazing piece of cinema, while realism is on a slight detour, it doesn't detract from the sheer brilliance of the John Wick universe, from start to finish it had me in awe, the lighting, the stages, action, etc. Everything about it was everything a movie should be. There's nothing I can write that could even compare to actually watching it. Exploring more of the world it has built up in the previous entries. Unlike most franchises these days, where more titles come out that gradually gets worse. This is the other end of such a spectrum, it gets better and better with each new entry, always adding something new.

Yen is a revelation in his role and Keanu has his character down pat, but let's give a little love to the supporting players. Hiroyuki Sanada brings his patented gravitas to his role as the manager of the Osaka Continental. Scott Adkins is both funny and badass in his fat suit. Shamier Anderson (and his dog) add a humorous touch to the proceedings. Lance Reddick (RIP), in a small role is very good and Ian McShane does his usual stand up performance. Other characters like Hiroyuki Sanada's daughter and the guy who plays the Marquis' bodyguard are very good, too. This is one of the best acted action movies ever."},{"users":"matty_moleskin","ratings":"4","titles":"A honest review by a non fan.","reviews":"Some context, of all the John Wick's, I'd seen the 2nd one, and thought it was great. However, after a 20 minute YouTube recap of all 3 I felt I was good to go. Although rather unnecessary as the movie is pretty easy to follow. So don't think it's important to have seen the others.I'll keep this simple:If you want to see 3 hours of well choreographed non-stop violence with some questionable decisions from the surrounding members of the public and some unfathomable bone break escapes from Mr Wick. Then this movie is for you.Went to see it in a packed IMAX and so many people around me were visibly bored and audibly exasperated with the movie.The one saving grace was a hilarious slapstick stairs moment towards the end which had the whole cinema laughing out loud.I did enjoy the warriors homage too.In a nutshell, if you want an excuse to eat a large popcorn then you'll have 3 action packed but long hours to get to the hard kernels at the bottom."},{"users":"greatbambino-56055","ratings":"10","titles":"Legendary John Wick franchise...John Wick 4 is AMAZING!!!","reviews":"My teenage children and I went to see John Wick 4 last night. We were all blown away by the nonstop action. For a 3 hour film it didn't have any weak spots in my opinion. The action scenes were great. The acting was great. A great movie overall.To think, the writers of John Wick didn't have any intentions on writing a sequel. However, with the great reception of the first film they've now built an empire. In all sincerity, I think the first 3 films were iconic. When I read online when John Wick 4 first came out that most believe it's the best so far, I definitely had to see for myself. And YUP! To me and my children...John Wick 4 is definitely the best so far. AMAZING!!! That's not to say that 1-3 weren't amazing in itself, but this one packs a freaking punch! Ain't nobody got anything on Jardani Jovonovich...aka the BOOGEYMAN!I remember watching some critics on a TV talkshow stating that John Wick is definitely one of the greatest action sagas ever but stated that the plot is average but the action is great. WHAT??? Evidently you critics are paying attention lol. The entire plot with the High Table is very intriguing. Of course it has some vagueness as to how the High Table was incepted, but that's the point. It leaves some mystery and is a great branch for continual films etc., etc., etc. I'm very much looking forward to more spinoffs. I'm a John Wick fan for life with both the good and the bad. Soooo, if you haven't seen any of the John Wicks...or at least haven't seen 4...SEE IT! SEE IT! SEE IT!!!P. S.

We would not be honest if we denied the fact that, over all things, this saga is sheer entertainment, powerful visuals of martial arts and gun fu, bigger than life destruction, a non stop pace, and a really thrilling concept of spectacle based on the point of \"more is more\". For if this alone wouldn't be enough, we have stunning suspense and the feel of enormous authority and strength of the French Marquis, and also the deeply emotional and satisfactory dramatic work of Hiroyuki Sanada and Donnie Yen.What else can I say? Simply WOW, since I have felt definitely blown away by the bird-eye shot in the building with infinite grenade shooting. But... what is infinite? If you are wondering about it, I only have to say: stairs, lots of stairs.The final duel at the sunrise is just deeply satisfying and leaves me thinking we need another fight with Keanu.

The movie takes us on a thrilling journey through Japan and Paris, showcasing their unique beauty and culture. The fight scenes are expertly choreographed, and Keanu Reeves' performance as John Wick continues to impress.However, the movie lacks depth and fails to inspire beyond its aesthetic appeal. The plot feels predictable and fails to introduce any new ideas or themes. While the action is impressive, it becomes repetitive and loses its impact as the movie progresses.Overall, John Wick Chapter 4 is a visually stunning movie that delivers in terms of action, but lacks the substance to truly captivate and inspire its audience. If you're a fan of the franchise or looking for an entertaining action movie, this movie won't disappoint.

However, the impression that I get from the first 3 John Wick movies is that he doesn't die and is incredibly skilled. In this though he dies after getting shot 3 times which he survives similar things in the other movies. Because of this it just feels like it was rushed and just missed the point of the rest of the franchise. The CGI was unimpressive but the last time I watched a new film it was Avatar: The Way Of Water so it might just be my expectations being set too high. On the bright side the extras were much better than in the previous films."},{"users":"raimy_dog","ratings":"10","titles":"Cinematic Masterpiece and a New level for action movies was set","reviews":"This is simply not just the best John Wick movie but one of the best action movies I have ever seen without exagerating, brutal, unique fighting scenes and epic cinematography overall.

This is by far the most accomplished Action, crime, thriller to date. The last time I've seen a movie this violently good was in Chow Yun Fat's break out role 34 Years ago called \"The Killer\". To this day I still don't know how they were able to fire so many bullets in one movie!!!\ud83d\ude05 JW4 is equally up there for the most bullets fired in a movie. A staggering logistical accomplishment on its own I won't be surprised if they win an award of some kind for that. The average movie goer looking into the franchise for the first time with this installment would be lost as to why the need to escalate to such madness. This is why if this is your thing and you haven't by some miracle seen the first 3 movies, you need to make that a priority before you go see this final chapter.With that aside the movie is a masterpiece. The best movie makers at the top of their skill set have successfully combined a great script, formidable actors, intricate set design, and special effects magic for a one of a kind spectacle that will definitely be remembered. I can not write this piece without mentioning the stand out performances of Bill Skarsgard(breakout new actor who plays pennywise from the movie \"It\") Scott Adkins(world renowned martial artist and Actor) Hiroyuki Sanada(Acclaimed Japanese action star) and Donnie Yen( World renowned martial artist and famed Chinese Actor) there characters gave the movie an extreme edge and a plethora of truly exiting moments. The entire cast brought their\"A\" game. What an ensemble!!!Other note worthy mentions was that the film was dedicated to the late Lance Reddick who played the concierge for the New York Continental Hotel in all 4 films. Lance sadly passed away a few weeks prior to the release of the final chapter, they honored him as well as he honored his roll. Despite it's violent nature, the movie promotes heavy moral values such as unconditional Love, True friendship, Honor, Respect,and the concept of Fealty.Retrospectively...yeah...I was literally on the edge of my seat the entire time. I would like to think that I am as nice of a guy as they come. I wouldn't begin to condone violence in any form shape or manner. However there is the innate awareness that violence is intrinsically a human trait, and very rarely do we have a Bruce Willis( Die Hard) Charles Bronson( Death Wish) Clint Eastwood( Dirty Harry) Mel Gibson( Lethal Weapon) Sylvester Stallone(Rambo) Tom Cruise( Mission Impossible) and now Keanue Reeves( John Wick) kind of film that inspires the good in all of us to fight for what is right!!!!!P.

The director's love for neon colours is clearly seen in the movie and the all the mythology about the high table, continentals about different hotels throughout the world the leaders who control it the rules on which this big assassin world works which the high table even cannot defy. The tone of the story is set from the start by the death of two important characters we know this time that the stakes are real and it is the best one till now .Those who cling to death live. -John."},{"users":"javed02","ratings":"10","titles":"Stoic John Wick","reviews":"I would like to start with a story about scorpion and sage: A wise and peaceful sage sees a scorpion drowning in the river and decides to rescue it. He lifts the scorpion out of the water, but the scorpion stings him and he drops it back. The sage tries again, but the scorpion stings him once more. The sage does not give up and attempts to save the scorpion for the third time, but he gets stung again. He asks the scorpion why it keeps hurting him when he is trying to help. The scorpion replied, \"I cannot help it. It is my nature to sting.\"The moral of the story is that some creatures cannot change their nature and it is important to accept this fact and act accordingly.This story applies to John Wick, a hitman who cannot escape his identity as an assassin. One character from the movie tells John that he is an assassin, and despite his efforts to get out of the business, he can't deny who he is. Even though John tries to avoid violence, he keeps getting pulled into it, and it's inevitable that he will continue to be a killer.The movie is a classic genre movie: action. The action genre in movies is a type of film that typically features fast-paced and thrilling physical stunts, fights, and chases. In the end, you do not feel cheated.One of the dialogues: \"The bloodshed wasn't necessary. But the bloodshed was the point.\" It seems like the characters do not seek to achieve any goal or outcome by shedding blood, but rather they enjoy the act itself as an end in itself. They only care about satisfying their bloodlust and proving their dominance.We often think that action is the best way to solve our problems and achieve our goals. But is that always true? What if our actions have negative consequences or go against our moral values? These questions challenge us to think more deeply about what it means to act and how our actions affect ourselves and others.The movie has amazing and beautiful action scenes. The stunts are awesome, and, again, the gunfights look more like dance moves. Wick is always so smooth and clever when he fights.The abundance of locations and vivid colors present a visual treat that is unmatched. The vivid imagery sets the perfect tone, both for the action and the dialogue. This movie offers an exceptional sensory journey, a rare treat not often found in action films. Every frame is dripping with texture and layers. There are so many things happening in the foreground and background, and yet you are never confused about what you have to focus on.The story of John Wick, brought to life by the masterful acting of Keanu Reeves, is a tale of human suffering and redemption. Wick, once a man of simple desires, finds himself thrust into a world of violence and revenge, driven by his past traumas and the desire for retribution.Reeves understands the depth of his character's suffering and portrays Wick not as a mere killing machine, but as a man with a soul that has been wounded by loss and grief. Despite the constant physical punishment he endures, Wick never loses sight of his humanity, and his pain only serves to reinforce his determination.Through Wick's struggles, we see the timeless truth that suffering is an inherent part of the human experience.One of the key tenets of stoicism is the idea that we should be indifferent to external circumstances. This does not mean that we should be unfeeling, but rather that we should strive to maintain a sense of inner calm. John Wick embodies this idea in many ways. Despite the numerous threats he faces, he remains calm and focused.Another important principle is the idea that we should focus on what we can control, rather than worrying about what we cannot. John Wick exemplifies this idea in his single-minded pursuit of his goals. When someone threatens him, he does not waste time on fruitless worry or despair. Instead, he takes action to protect himself and those around him, using his skills and experience.In short, John Wick is not just a deadly assassin, but also a stoic philosopher. Through his actions and demeanor, he embodies many of the key principles of stoicism.John Wick 4 is action cinema turned into high art by creators who believe that every single one of the countless kills in this movie still has to look cool as hell.

The story was a simple continuation of the previous part. The performances by all the cast members were good and memorable.One different and new thing I noticed in this part was that the movie had a lot of emotional elements attached to it. This felt a little bit weird to me as the previous installments only focused on action and nothing else. I faced one more problem and that was the pacing of the movie. The movie felt fast at some moments and slow at other moments, in other words, the pacing was inconsistent.

Everyone gets a motivation that's understandable and leads them to clash with others often in a fight between them.Chad stahelski has improved hugely as a director its no longer just cool stunts but now he's really matured as a director he plays to his strengths and the directing is by far one of the best aspects of the movieThe film looks amazing not just the colors but the action pursues onscreen is just jawdropping with people performing these stunts live in front of you and you feel every punch hit kick stab and that's truly a credit to the stunt performers here and the vfx team that helped bring it all together. Now the film is 169 minutes long. However I didn't feel the 3 hours and instead it felt like 1 hour and 40 minutes which is a magical feet of editing and pacing.The films side charachters have their own storylin eand events. The most memorable is caine played by donnie yen a blind assassin and a old friend of John whose sent by Bill Skargards marquee the highest ranked of the high table to kill john wick and seeing how john has nothing to lose you actually feel sorry for caine as its clear he doesn't want to do what he's been tasked with doing but is aware of what happens if rules are broken and it makes him a very interesting charachter that I would love to have a spin off film with. Other memorable side characters are mr nobody or tracker as he's listed here on imdb (shaming anderson) is a low class assassin whose after john however is on and off between going ahead with what he's set out to do for personal reasons and then we have shimazy (hiroyuki sanada) whose a owner of a continental in Japan and gets a set piece to shine as well as his daughter AKira (Rina sawayama) who blames john for breaking the rules and fears for her fathers safety.The bowery king (Lawrence fishbourne), winston (Ian mc shane) and charon (lance reddick r.i.p) are all here and have their own reasons for helping john tldr every charachter here is excellent and brought to life in such a way that you forget that they're not real people and just actors playing them this also goes for keanu reeves as john wick he's brilliant here and we all know that he does his own stunts which is really the draw for these movies but this one is amazing in all departments. He'll even the soundtrack is amazing here tyler bates and Joel j Richards score is present in the film and benefits the action on screen and over all film.The film also gives john a satisfying resolution to his story over the 4 movies.The only other action movies I'd put above this is die hard and terminator 2 judgement day to even be compared to those movies should scream see this movie if it doesint I don't know what will.See this in cinemas ideally a imax cinema and don't wait till its on a streaming service this was made to be seen on the biggest screen possible.So overall, It's a 10\/10 movie that you should absolutely see in cinemas if at all possible you won't regret it and is by far the best action film since the matrix in 1999.

Despite being the fourth movie in the franchise, it's clear that the filmmakers haven't run out of tricks, and the result is a movie that is as fresh and exciting as the first.Keanu Reeves' portrayal of the world-weary assassin is masterful, with his weariness and struggles palpable throughout the film. The high stakes and increased death count make the character's journey even more intense, and Reeves rises to the challenge with ease.The action sequences in John Wick: Chapter 4 are nothing short of spectacular. Each set piece is magnificently choreographed and shot, with a clear homage to classic martial-arts genres and Hollywood Westerns. The movie also manages to top everything that's come before in the franchise, with new and creative ways to keep the audience engaged.It's also worth mentioning that the film is an absolute joy to watch in IMAX, with the immersive experience making the action sequences all the more thrilling.While the weight of trying to top everything that's come before is not lost on the filmmakers, they rise to the challenge with elegance and creativity, delivering a movie that is both a homage to the classic action genre and a fresh addition to the franchise.In short, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a killer night out at the movies. With an incredible performance from Keanu Reeves, stunning visuals, and non-stop action, it's a must-watch for fans of the series and anyone looking for an immersive and thrilling cinematic experience."},{"users":"avilon-48406","ratings":"10","titles":"As others said this is the best action marshal arts film ever made","reviews":"The furousty of the fights , the camera work , the cinematography and the speed of events is something never done B4 in any film not even in the other John Wick films.Keanu Reeves looked tired in the film and exosted from the phyiscal effort of shooting so many realistic marshal art scenes.

A few chuckles in the cinema in this otherwise intense film.As mentioned before, the choreography is utterly impressive, thinking about the amount of time rehearsals took is scary.

The action in this is by far the best; most intense and realistic (whatever that means in the wickiverse) in the series, with the least amount of noticeable \"dumb bad guy\" flubs. It also has some of the coolest cinematography I've seen in any action film. Kudos for being able to make a killer third sequel, progressively getting better in regards to general film making, while reusing the same general plot- something not even lethal weapon could pull off.

Amazing performance, make up, sound, locations etc. It was incredible.At the same time, I love the way Winston was there, the iconic Continental Hotel, the brand, the family, etc. In other action movies it feels really fake when it comes to revenge because of family situations but in this one I love the way that really he had to become part of the family to fight."},{"users":"junaidrajput-70175","ratings":"10","titles":"Possibly the best action movie ever!","reviews":"This movie has everything, great story, beautifully written character archs and out of this world action...!Having such a great star cast, all the stars performed very well, especially Donny yen and hiroku sanada.It has an all star cast and dur to this fact it is an eye candy to watch.

The locations are pretty good, I guess sometimes we could notice some green screen, like in one portion of the movie where theres cars in a circle.. and at the end, it would be more cool if it were filmed in a real location with real lightning. But the movie us very cool, when its not showing new characters that dont develop too much, or they want you to care about them more than you really care.When it comes to writing and dialogs I feel that this movie is very, very generic, my favorite is 3 cuz its just an action movie with enough dialog and lots of shooting, this one has more talking than action and i felt bored a lot, cuz everything is a cliche, Keanu barely has lines, and thats the bad part of the movie, all the talking. But I understand thats cuz this one is a goodbye from Wick,or maybe not.Another thing that bothered me was the Kevlar suit, that everyone has, even the assassins that are not wearing a suit have kevlar clothes, that really bothered me, sometimes I could notice people getting shoot at the head ( bald guys ) and the bullet just ricocheting, thats was weird.. I feel that in this movie Keanu is superman, nothing touches him, he can fall from 4-5 floors and nothing happens, and in the previous movies Wick was not superman, he didnt have powers or anything like that, thats a bad thing too, cuz I didnt feel the stakes.I didnt like the blind man, a blind man is a insane killer in a world with snipers?

The characters don't make sense. Not to mention making John Wick practically bulletproof.I expected something better, something different, not the same from the 3rd part.

This is possibly the best action movie since a long time.

This movie is an action-packed spectacle on EVERY level.I believed the action in Chapter 3 couldn't be outdone... oh boy, was I wrong. The action in this is some of the most astonishing I've ever seen in film or television. The incredible, vibrant, sleek cinematography showcased throughout adds nicely to the already intense action sequences. I feel like I have to give major props to the cinematographer Dan Laustsen, who is a master of his craft. The cinematography is likewise reinforced by the brilliant locations and sets exhibited. Not once was an area dull, every single location was beautifully vibrant. Another significant boost for this film is the epic and invigorating soundtrack that is flawlessly utilized.The cast of characters in this film are all fleshed out and very well written. Donnie Yen does an outstanding job portraying the bad-ass yet suave Caine. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd also does a fantastic job playing the powerful and egocentric Vincent de Gramont. The lead, Keanu Reeves, once again kills it as the undoubtedly ferocious John Wick.This movie may very well go down as one of the best action films of the 21st century, and in my opinion, it is a title that is well deserved."},{"users":"tommyjp-75964","ratings":"9","titles":"HAS TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN!","reviews":"All the john wick films are incredible, but none are as good as this one.

Chad Stahelski added exactly the perfect amount of action into the movie, not too much and not too few. It had enough scenes about John Wick's background in the movie (in my opinion) and the new characters really were a good addition to the movie. The scene that was shot from above (the old apartment fight scene) was unbelievably good, the set was so well decorated, the soundtrack was very good and the stunts in this and all other scenes were perfect.

Well unfortunately with this Caine character I just couldn't get into it, for a blind guy to be doing what he was doing throughout the movie in what was very much a main role was just too ridiculous and ruined the whole movie for me.

New characters are probably my favourite part of this movie. They gave so much, especially because John doesn't talk much. Only minus I have is one action scene on stairs too much and that's it.

As a huge fan of the first 3 films, I didn't think the action could be topped, especially when compared to parabellum, but this film takes it to insane new heights. Of course you need to suspend disbelief into the statistical impossibility that john wick has somehow survived the onslaught of enemies, but who cares when it's this entertaining. The film uses lots of different styles and weapons and has some amazing setpieces but everything always feels real and in the moment... largely due to it mostly being real, with the actors and stuntmen giving it everything.Action aside, I still think this is the best john wick film in terms of quality...keanu reeves is excellent as always but the film has a real weight to it and is brilliantly written and directed, with flashes of humour that dont feel forced, and stunning cinematography. The fact that the movie is nearly 3 hours long and doesn't drag for a second is a testament to how great it really is.Overall, if this is the final John Wick film, the excellent franchise has went out at its absolute apex.

And let me tell you, it did not disappoint.Keanu Reeves once again delivers a jaw-dropping performance as the titular character, John Wick. The film picks up right where Chapter 3 left off, with John on the run from the High Table after breaking the rules of the assassin's world.The action sequences in Chapter 4 are simply incredible. From hand-to-hand combat to gun fights, the choreography is top-notch and will leave you on the edge of your seat. And the fact that Reeves does most of his own stunts only adds to the realism and intensity of the fight scenes.But it's not just the action that makes this movie great. The story is also compelling, with John seeking revenge against those who have wronged him while also trying to navigate the complex world of assassins and their rules.The supporting cast also shines in Chapter 4, with standout performances from Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne, and newcomer Donnie Yen. And of course, the dogs make a welcome return and are just as badass as ever.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a must-see for fans of the franchise and action movie lovers in general.

What a kinetic end to the John Wick story","reviews":"...or is it?The wife and I went home after watching this on opening night and immediately queued up the first John Wick that kicked everything off. I remarked after the scene when his puppy is killed in that first film \"and this is what started a nonstop body count that ended up somewhere over 1,000 and spanned four films!!\" I think this supplanted the Bond franchise in terms of being more in touch with the kind of 21st century post-Tarantino violence film goers have come to expect from our favorite assassin with a very big chip on his shoulder.Such a shame to have lost Lance Reddick. Just glad we got to see him on the screen one final time. He and Ian McShane embodied The Continental and brought it to life.We never once grew bored or weary during the nearly 3-hour runtime. As with each prior film, the action only grew more frenetic and continued unabated from the opening scene. Bill Skarsgard has obviously cornered the market playing creepy baddies, and his Marquis was wonderfully understated yet menacing. Hiroyuki Sanada, Shamier Anderson, Clancy Brown (THE KERGAN!), and Donnie Yen all delivered in their respective roles as erstwhile allies or opponents.

John Wick has killed so many and witnessed the death of his wife. So why not just save the pain for many other families. Especially for his Japanese friend, he died because he wanted to protect John Wick. People either got killed by him or died because of helping him. And the girl, who had absolutely wanted not to be part of it, lost her dad, her family business, and got shot. How brutal it was. I like the girl because someone at least spoke up to John, told him that all the sacrifices were not necessary. But John Wick seemed to think the different way: everyone can die because I want to live.

Council represents the richest people in the world beyond who we know and people work for them(like Marchese de Grant) are the ones that we know as the richest ones. As we see in the dico scene society is not aware of what is actually happening. As a big fan of John Wick movie, chapter 4(I guess the last chapter) was the most exciting one.

If you've seen any of the the first three John Wick movies, you know they are action filled.....But get ready for a new standard in packing action into a movie. New guns, new twists, so much excitement. It is a long movie, but if you like tons of fighting and action it keeps you wanting more. It's definitely a popcorn flick, but so good and entertaining. Unlike the last three Wick movies, Chapter 4 had the audience laughing out loud at several scenes. Without being a spoiler, I'll just say there are a few really funny things that happen. We absolutely loved it and can't wait for Chapter 5. Keanu is great!!"},{"users":"delvinarnold","ratings":"10","titles":"The world of assassins are in battle","reviews":"Donnie has gone an excellent act of a disabled assassin that battled every fight.

The character of Caine applied to the biblical example of being a sinner so Donnie has done an excellent job of being good guy and bad guy in Marquis's expectations.Donnie also done excellent acting as the disabled assassin in the mob world and challenged John Wick, Caine's friend into the battle.

No, it'll keep you entertained for the most part.The set pieces are beautiful as to be expected and the plot is ok.Then what's the problem?This movie has 2 big problems... The new characters and the action sequences.Donnie Yens role (Caine) is literally a video game character (Blind Kenshi)! He felt out of place in this film.Then there is the black guy who is a military cowboy...? I mean OK I guess but he added nothing to this film.Now we get to the action scenes which in my opinion is the movies biggest flaw.There was a flow to the action scenes in the previous 3 films but not here. In this movie the gunplay feels wasted because every character is wearing armor or some bulletproof suit, which means that everybody using a gun has to use it the exact same way...all head shots with no variation.Ok but guys can still fight right?No...not really most of the hand to hand combat is broken up by you guessed it more gunplay.There is a part early on in the film where John is fighting with nunchaku and my man clearly don't know how to use them. He just looks sluggish in every scene.In closing the movie ain't terrible but it's not a masterpiece either. I still love the series but I can see this turning into the fast and the furious if it continues."},{"users":"Jeremy_The_Legend","ratings":"10","titles":"Delivers exactly what you are expecting.","reviews":"John Wick 4 is a masterpiece of a movie that leaves no room for disappointment.

The score is so good that you can't help but feel pumped up and ready for anything.The non-stop action is what really sets John Wick 4 apart from other action movies. From the very beginning, the movie hits the ground running and never lets up. There's never a dull moment, and the pacing is perfect. It's a testament to the director's skill that he was able to keep the action going for the entire runtime without ever feeling repetitive or stale.And let's not forget about Keanu Reeves. His performance is intense, emotional, and captivating. He brings a level of depth to the character that is rarely seen in action movies. You can feel his pain, his determination, and his resolve in every scene.

Is like he still thinks he has a chance even though he knows how it's all going to end, why bother? What impulses this guy so much to the point of becoming immortal, Donnie yeng knows john has lived enough and that he needs to finish this, caine easily could be the star if it wasn't for keanu these 2 guys make this film what it is, action from the beginning till the end, \"worth watching\" stays short for JOHN WICK CHAPTER 4."},{"users":"tinkulalwani","ratings":"10","titles":"Best Thriller Movie","reviews":"Really a great thriller movie.

In fact, my friend who hasn't seem any of the movies fell asleep half way.The friend who has seen a few, said the only thing he liked is the filmography.Me, on the other hand, during the second part of the movie, understood that I came to watch a movie whose main goal is to blow you away with its incredible fight scenes and effects. And that it does. Don't expect much storytelling or really any story at all, because after watching the movie, it felt like I just watched the 3 series of the franchise again, however with the great action that a Wick movie has to offer.In all, if you are a hard John Wick fan, you'll be happy with probably the best Wick movie in the franchise, however if you are looking for an interesting script, which will get you close to your screen, don't.Good film.

But when they brought in a dj towards the latter part of the film the film lost my support. The reason for this is that it is a direct rip-off of the Warriors, one of my favorite films. From the dialogue to the use of Nowhere to Run, it was the director's insert that, excuse the expression, proverbially killed the movie for me. I read after seeing the movie that the director wanted to homage the film but this extraneous garbage was so cringe for me. Maybe a lot of people who never saw the Warriors won't care, but for me, it displayed a useless insert. It was almost word for word plagiarism. It took me out of the film until the final scene when I was sort of able to finish the film with some assemblage of enjoyment. Sad how certain things can ruin a good thing. Oh, and the tag after the credits was so predictable, especially since word got out that certain surviving characters were spinning off into their own films, etc. If that dj scene weren't in the film, I'd be giving it a higher rating."},{"users":"shyamgautam-07737","ratings":"10","titles":"Absolutely Badass","reviews":"Absolutely entertaining and Best of the best action movie ever made.

The culture of one the friends of wick is pretty cool. Parts of Germany, France, and New York great scenes and the fights. Spoiler alert there a lot of gun shots.

So much of this movie is done to perfection. To start the locations they picked for this one are absolutely gorgeous. So many unique buildings and history spots that they capture beautifully. The fight choreography blends perfectly with them and they play really well off of eachother. So much variety with weapon types and fighting styles in the scenes with some new stuff that I hadn't seen in the previous films.And the music!! Goes so well with the action and in particular I loved the scenes where the music is paired with the radio. A lot of amazing camera work. Specifically the overhead one shot take of one of the fight scenes. Wow. I would see the movie again just for that scene. Would love to see some behind the scenes of it. All of the new characters were great additions too.My only critique is one of the beginning fight scenes felt a little too similar to a museum fight scene in one of the other films.

It was long but felt necessary and never lost my interest."},{"users":"reginaldx","ratings":"9","titles":"You won't be disappointed","reviews":"This newest chapter is honestly just as good, if not better, than the first one. I was a little concerned since the two previous ones only got crazier and crazier, trying to one up each other. But this one's story, plot, set pieces, and action is actually the best we've seen from the franchise so far. The casting was perfect, all the actors did a phenomenal job and I can't forget about Lance Reddick.

Chapter 4 took this series to levels I did not even think were possible, the last 3 entries in the series were absolutely amazing and were near perfection but chapter 4 is the best by a mile. From Director Chad Stahelski comes the 4th installment of the long running franchisee which is not showing any sign of slowing down. It's like drinking old wine which just tastes better with age and such is the case with John wick series so far, the current one better than the last one.Well this time stakes are all time high with the High table hell bent on finishing John wick off once and for all by any means Necessary. But the thing is this time our Protagonist is not being hunted like his last outing but is hunting his way up the table in his pursuit for freedom and getting closure on his wife.This installment has doubled down on everything be it headcounts, length of the action sequences to the gorgeous Cinematography. The use of different light settings in different world zones of Osaka, Paris, Berling or Newyork is a sight to behold which just ups the ante in every possible way. The use of BGM when any action sequence kicks off simply ignites the adrenaline rush until it keeps you wanting for more in a breathtaking style."},{"users":"esulk-63906","ratings":"10","titles":"This movie is a work of art","reviews":"The best action movie I have ever seen in my life I recommend it for all the action scenes, the sound effects and especially the cinematic effects of movement around the shot excellent \ud83d\udc4c with the lighting effects of the locations it was crazy.the best of the franchise, the length is about 3 hours, it doesn't feel heavy, it's the best, the scenes in Tokyo are very enjoyable, the new weapons, WOW very cool, great that they include new martial arts actors, it was super to see them fight, the change of focus that the character suffers is incredible, the action exceeded my expectations, you really have to see it.

Upon the ending of the 4th installment, I can say with confidence that this is likely the best action movie ever made. I stray away from action movies due to overused tropes, abundant cgi, and weak characters. This franchise breaks the mold, and gives us well thought out characters that we CARE about. Its ideas are fresh and exciting. The cinematography here may get Oscar- nominated. The fight choreography is simply the best in the business.Aside from Wick taking some unrealistic falls and brushing them off as only a bruise, I was wholly engrossed in # 4 for its almost 3 hour run time.

Still the movie feels bland in my opinion. Action scenes keep getting overly complex and you start disbelieving them due to their complexity. Chapter one worked because the action was (with some suspended disbelief) believable. As the saga continued we get a Fast & Furious problem where it just doesn't make any sense story wise or action wise.Yes the action is well shot, the cinematic is incredible, but just no believable anymore. The movie fails in that respect.Also the movie inside world of the High Table seems even more far off than before. Yes the High Table wants to kill John Wick. Now who is the high table? What do they want?Control\/money\/power? All 3?I would have enjoyed seeing the high table politics in action, seeing the network of high profile politicians under their wing working and making plans. Just Kill John wick is a lame motivation.Also the Movie is way to long for the average consumer. Studios are trying to figure out why people don't go to the movies anymore? They make their movies almost 3 hours long and fill them with pointless scenes.Still I enjoyed my cinema experience but I would have enjoyed it more if they made their movie more down to earth and shorter. Also if they showed more of the high table instead of 40 action scenes that are all mostly the same concept."},{"users":"mikefooyc","ratings":"7","titles":"Pros: nice visuals and face paced actions Cons: plot too predictable and action scenes can look fake","reviews":"Watched all 3 John Wick and was excited about the 4th installment.

Fight arenas where huge fights break out are visually stunning just like the previous installment.Sound composer is superb with subtle heart rhythm in certain scenes, although not Christopher Nolan level but certainly very interesting use of sound effects.Vast array of weapons used and some interactions conducted in the local language which is what the real world is like. You don't go to some foreign country expecting their people especially big time crime lords to speak English all the time. I also see someone took inspiration from Jackie Chan stunt technique to make some fight scene looks serious and comical at the same time.At the end of the movie, it's a huge relief seeing the burden being lifted of John Wicks, the man himself Keanu Reeves and the moviegoers whom have been diligently following through a 4 movies.The cons and spoilers"},{"users":"menashek-83305","ratings":"10","titles":"Best of the wick franchise this far","reviews":"10\/10 best movie of the year I will definitely rewatch it on the weekend highly recommend"},{"users":"uno-84968","ratings":"8","titles":"Solid ending to the John Wick saga","reviews":"John Wick 4 improves on its predecessor which was arguably too goofy and over the top, replacing it with more believable lore and mythology, being the best of the sequels to the original.Excellent casting with experienced action stars , great action although John Wick is immune to car hits and falling from windows, still pack a punch, and a better more realistic story makes Chapter 4 quite good.John wick dying was a poetic end to his character and doing another sequel would need something truly special to avoid feeling uncessary"},{"users":"pantstco","ratings":"10","titles":"Satisfying end (?) to an awesome franchise.","reviews":"Where do I begin?I'm writing this review after watching the movie two times in 2 days.

The locations and lighting... just wow. I was worried at first about all of the new characters introduced but I fell in love with them not long after. Caine is an amazing character who is an amazing fighter showing strength with a disability. I also love Killa and his fight with John, the music, scenery and the fight was just jaw dropping. Huge props to Le Castle Vania for the pumping music with these scenes, and the use of the music from the first film in that dynamically directed *dragons breath* scene was just everything I ever wanted. I must say this movie is like... the aesthetic of my soul, and will live on in my heart, it inspires me in my studies as I do character design, art and photography. Thank u Chad.

The fight scenes are some of the most intricate and well-executed I have ever seen on the big screen. The movements are fluid and seamless, with each strike and block perfectly timed and executed.

It felt like there was too much colors in the scenes.John Wick has aged a bit and that was Okay.It felt like it was some kind of funny fights rather than serious. Wick had so much energy and endurance during the fights it came to a point you can think unrealistic. The locations of the world Paris was interesting but i think movie could been filmed more at day time and less at night. Tokyo or whatever the city was was okay for the scenes.The audio was good nothing wrong here. The effects, and sound effects was well done.My complaint is as i never had the chance to see the ending is that during these two hours i could watch in the cinema the story was..um.. lacking a lot!It was quite nice to see Keanu Reeves on screen though.The fighting scenes was brutal and wick basically executed his enemies one after another in line.I don't know... the movie would had bigger potential with a stronger story and different world locations.I honestly think the previous movies were higher standards.

This movie was an absolute masterpiece. The filmmakers really outdid themselves with this one, and not in a good way.

It was like the filmmakers just threw a bunch of random scenes together and called it a day. Two of my friends actually fell asleep during the movie. I mean, who needs heart-pumping, adrenaline-fueled fights when you can have characters just standing around and talking for no reason?And speaking of boring content, there was plenty of that in this movie. And apparently I wasn't the only one suffering, because someone in the movie theater actually soiled themselves. Yep, you read that right. John Wick 4 was so bad that it caused bodily functions to malfunction.All in all, I would say that John Wick 4 was the worst of the franchise. But hey, at least it had some redeeming qualities, like the fact that it was over and I could leave the theater. So if you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep or make you lose control of your bowels, then John Wick 4 is the perfect choice for you."},{"users":"Spoiledbrahmin","ratings":"8","titles":"Bloodies movie in the last decade & for the next 10 years","reviews":"All of the crooks that appeared in the film were real-life criminals and mafia members who were paid astronomical sums of money to appear in it. Bringing in the best of these guys isn't the easy part, KUDOS to the entire team.Director Chad Stahelski did put every effort to bring in the best of Keanu and the case, Wick is Wicked and absolute fruckingly made action movie.Stands out with the top list of action movies ever made, should be proud for the time the production team took and what they have delivered.NO other best way to give farewell to Lance Reddick.Best screenplay and it's the original content, waiting for the 4 hour long cut on the screens."},{"users":"ewigergert","ratings":"7","titles":"Good fighting scenes. Bad story and dialogues","reviews":"The fighting is nice but it gets quite a repetitive in an almost l three hour movie.The story is very weak, the whole killer guild thing is so made up. And where the hell. Is the police?The dialogues are bad. It wouldn't make a difference if there is no conversation at all.Also I didn't get the whole thing with the blind man and his daughter. Why did he sacrifice his eyes? What did he do wrong to put his daughter into trouble? What's the point of the man and his dog. He is quite unnecessary.Shogare even fall into sleep in the last hour.7 Stars because of the good fight with the fat guy in the club and because I like Keanu."},{"users":"winsonchow","ratings":"10","titles":"Such as life","reviews":"Love it love it love it!! Awesome fights scenes and very creative and hilarious in the middle of it. And the dog wow i love him so cute but so deadly and the owner saying balls like what is That command \ud83d\ude02 and the twist of the end saving the last bullet very smart of him and saved his friend daughter and his life is just John Wick style the fight scenes we're so good and the drone shot of the fighting scene from above was so smart felt like i was playing a video game of John Wick im sad that yuki died tho and the super soldiers costume were cool and the high table gaurds were so cool and the paris car roundabout was also a good fight scence."},{"users":"proulxalex","ratings":"8","titles":"A ridiculous comedic action movie?","reviews":"Well... how to begin?While the movie is super well made with plenty of fights and special effects... what I'm looking for in a movie (generally) is the suspension of disbelief, but you can forget about that for this movie... some scenes are so ludicrous and ridiculous they made me chuckle and I lost focus more than once.I'm not sure if it was intended... but it felt more like a comedic action movie than an action movie like the 3 previous movies were. Some scene were cut and pieces of previous scene with a different angle or something... the movie felt like a parody of itself half way through... maybe it was intented that way? I was confused to say the least.That being said I was greatly entertained, thus the 8 stars."},{"users":"heydarniyam","ratings":"10","titles":"Mesmerizing more than ever","reviews":"JW 4 has the potential to be the best of the franchise yet made. The screenwriting is more coherent and adequate. It introduces great new characters that could be developed more profoundly and discovered thoroughly. They have maintained the legacy of JW and its brutal nature meanwhile adding new notions like brotherhood, fatherhood and father-daughter relationship. Cinematography and fight choreography are perfect ; capturing dim theme of JW and its true nature. Caine and Mr. Nobody are fantastic characters that need further attention. For instance, as a fan, I'm eager to know more about his background and how he became blind. I also like to know more about Mr. Nobody's background and his ability to be a great stalker( in a way). I enjoyed Scott Adkins portrayal in the movie. He was well processed and his character is really gruesome. With all that being said, I think this one is by far the best one and if they end it here (which I don't think that would be the case), it'll be a great farewell to John Wick's world."},{"users":"hugoermann","ratings":"10","titles":"Amazing","reviews":"Loved the movie. Was dying to see this and movie didn't dissapoint. Post-credit scene could lead into a spin-off, but I think that issue will be resolved in \"Ballerina\". John Wicks death was unexpected and I don't really think he died. Even though the movie was long, it didn't feel empty. Always something going on. Also loved the characters. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd portraid his character perfectly. A little dissapointed that concierge didn't get much screen time. ( Rest in peace Lance Reddick ). Overall I say go watch the movie in your free time. 10\/10 definetly go see it in ur local cinema. For sure rewatching in a month or two."},{"users":"ksethi-30375","ratings":"10","titles":"THE BEST John Wick movie ever","reviews":"Great action sequences, next level camera work.
